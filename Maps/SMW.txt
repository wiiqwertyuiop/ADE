Format: xx yy xx yy xx yy [...] $FF
The XXs is the value to store to $15, except that the Select flag (#$20) is instead used to tell if the XY flag (#$40) should be masked away from $16 (if it's set, that bit is stored to $16 unchanged; if clear, that bit is masked away. All other bits are stored to $16.)
The YYs is how long to keep that value there. Setting an XX to $FF ends it.

Change x2159 from D0 to 90 to eliminate all fadeouts. (use in conjunction with x212F). Mod note: I've heard that this one is buggy. Use on your own risk.
x2167 controls which layers are affected by the mosaic effect.
Format: xxxx4321.
The numbers present the layer numbers to add mosaic on. So 1 = Layer 1, 2 = Layer 2, etc.
$00:9F88	48 bytes	Layer 3	Layer 3 settings. The table is indexed by 3t + i, where t is the tileset number and i is the Layer 3 image setting (00 = variable tide, 01 = low tide, 02 = tileset-specific image). It is used by the routine at $009FB8. The actual format seems to be:
01 = variable-height tide
02 = fixed-height tide
80 = Layer 3 smashers/cage
81 = slow-auto-scrolling background (except in tilesets 1 and 3, where it will be a background that scrolls at half the rate Layer 1 does)

Both $00A04E and $00A04F are the low byte of the Map16 tile that the tides act like; nothing is stored to the high byte, so this is always on page 0.
$00:A06B	14 bytes	Coordinate	16-bit X-coordinates for each of the seven submaps. The main map has values of 0, and is overridden elsewhere.
$00:A079	14 bytes	Coordinate	16-bit Y-coordinates for each of the seven submaps. The main map has values of 0, and is overridden elsewhere.

$00:A0F9	1 byte	ASM	Part of the routine that runs after dying with zero lives. 

If # of levels beat is zero, then it will take you back to the intro screen, if levels beat is positive, it will take you back to the last place you saved on the OW and bring up the Continue/End dialog.

Change this byte to BRA ($80) to cause it to not send you to the intro screen and bring up the Continue/End dialog if you haven't saved for the first time. (In other words, it will take you back to Yoshi's House on an unedited overworld.)

WARNING: Will disable the animated colours on the OW too!
$00:A439	1 byte	Misc.	Change [F0] (BEQ) to [80] (BRA) to prevent various tiles in SP1 to be overwritten (which meant using ExGFX for them would have no effect). This does not affect tiles 00-09, 10-19 and 7F of SP1.

$00:BEB0	268 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	SMW's Map16-tile-generating routine. It uses values of $9C to determine which tile to generate, but these values are hardcoded. (See RAM address $9C.) This is the main part; $00BFBC runs the codes for each tile.
$00:BFBC	67 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	A subroutine used with $00BEB0; it runs different codes depending on the value of $9C. The pointers for the different values begin at $00BFC9. They go from 01 to 1B, although the actual codes are kind of weird...the pointers vary depending on which Map16 page the tile is on, whether or not item memory should be affected, and if there are special cases (such as the Yoshi coin, which generates two tiles simultaneously).
$00:C00D	86 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	The subroutine that sets item memory bits. It is called during the subroutine at $00BEB0 for values of $9C that utilize item memory.

$00:C074	54 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	SMW's subroutine for generating tiles on Map16 page 0. $00C077 is an alternate entry point to this routine; if it is used instead, then the tile generation will not affect item memory.
$00:C0B2	15 bytes	Misc.	Tiles to generate on Map16 page 1, used for values 0A-17 of $9C.
$00:C0C1	58 bytes	ASM	A portion of code used in SMW for generating tiles on Map16 page 1. $00C0C4 is an alternate entry point to this routine; if it is used instead, then the tile generation will not affect item memory.

$00:C9BD	1 byte	Music	Goal point fade-out music
$00:C9FE	3 bytes	ASM	[8D D5 0D] The code itself stores either 01 or 02 to $0DD5. Change to [EA EA EA] to make it possible to set the normal/secret exit info through $0DD5 via LevelASM, sprites, etc. (Note: To activate any exit at all, $0DD5 has to be explicitly set to 01 or 02. Leaving it as 00 will cause no exit to be activated at all, and values 03-FF should not be used.)
$00:CA0C	1 byte	Level number	Translevel number of the level where defeating a boss will activate the secret exit.
$00:CA12	2 bytes	Misc.	[C9 31] Changing this to [80 11] will prevent any "boss defeated" scenes from ever being played.
$00CA13 is one of the two level numbers that triggers the credits scene. The other is at $00C9AE.

They are indexed by the frame counter.
$00:CEA1	8 bytes	Mario tilemap	Spinjump direction table.
$00:CEA9	8 bytes	Mario tilemap	Cape spin cape image table. 

These are run while spin jumping with a cape or doing a spin attack. Only these four cape images ($02,$07,$06,$09) seem to work with cape contact, and will only work if RAM $14A6 is above zero.
$00:CEBE	1 byte	Mario physics	Amount of frames to show the cape at highest altitude frame. (After, for example, a spin-jump has been done.)
$00:CF42	1 byte	Mario physics	Power-up that can attack with both cape spin and spin jump
$00:CF75	1 byte	Mario tilemap	[3F] Mario shooting fireball on ground pose.
$00:CF7B	1 byte	Mario tilemap	[16] Mario shooting fireball in air pose.
$00:CF90	1 byte	Mario tilemap	[0F] Mario turning around while holding item pose.
$00:CFCA	1 byte	Controller	Which button to press to look up. (Look at Ram Address $7E:0015 for values).
$00:CFCB	1 byte	Mario physics	Change from [F0] to [80] to disable looking up.
$00:CFCE	1 byte	Mario tilemap	This is the player looking up pose, the default is #$03.
$00:D034	8 bytes	Mario physics	Cape Collision X (Horizontal) Offsets: Two bytes for right and left, on ground and in air.

The first two sets are for when Mario is on the ground while spinning ($0C,$00- right; $F4,$FF left), and the second two are while he is in the air ($08,$00 - right; $F8,$FF - left)

The first byte in each set determines the position per pixel, the second sets whether it is in front or behind him ($FF is behind, $00 is in front) Use $FF-$80 for the behind byte($FF), and $00-$79 for the in front byte ($00)

This does not effect the image offsets.
$00:D03C	8 bytes	Mario physics	Cape Collision Y (Vertical) Offsets: 2 bytes for right and left, on ground and in air.

The first two sets are for when Mario is on the ground while spinning ($10,$00 - right; $10,$00 - left), and the second two are while he is in the air ($02,$00 - right; $02,$00 - left)

The first byte in each set determines the position per pixel, the second sets whether it is above him or below him ($FF is below his feet, $00 is from his feet up) Use $FF-$80 for the below byte ($FF), and $00-$79 for the above byte ($00)

This does not effect the image offsets.
$00:D044	30 bytes	Mario physics	Routine that does the actual calculation for cape-interaction. Uses the two tables at x05234 and x0523C.
$00:D062	31 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	Cape Swing routine.
x5265 controls which power-up the player needs to have to be able to cape spin.
Change x5267 to 00 to make mario cape spin in all forms.
x5277 controls how long Cape Spin lasts.
x527C controls the cape spin sound effect to generate.

$00D082 (05282) is the power-up that can throw fireball
Change $00D084 (05284) to 00 to make Mario throw Fireballs in all forms.
Change $00D085 (05285) from A5 73 to EA EA to enable shooting fireballs while ducking.
Change $00D087 (05287) from 0D 7A 18 to EA EA EA to enable shooting fireballs from Yoshi.
Change $00D08A (0528A) to 80 do disable Fireball Shooting.
Change $00D093 (05293) from F0 to 80 to disable fireball shooting while spin jumping.
$00:D0B9	1 byte	Mario tilemap	Mario death pose (uses RAM $13E0)
$00:D0D5	3 bytes	ASM	Set 9C C1 0D to EA EA EA in order to not lose Yoshi on the OW when you fall down a pit when on top of Yoshi.
$00:D0D8	3 bytes	ASM	ASM that handles losing lives. Change to [EA EA EA] to not lose a life after dying. Change to [80 03 EA] to always go to the Game Over screen when dying.
$00:D0DE	1 byte	Music	Game Over music
$00:D0F1	1 byte	ASM	ASM that handles the 'TIME UP!' message. Change 'D0' to '80' to disable it.
$00:D11A	1 byte	ASM	Change [85] to [60] and Mario will not flip X-wise when he dies.
$00:D11D	12 bytes	Mario tilemap	Mario Shrinking Animation poses (uses RAM $13E0). 0531D - 05328
$00:D141	1 byte	Timer	How long flashing invincibility (when you get hit) lasts
$00:D156	5 bytes	ASM	Change to EE E4 18 EA 64 to turn the Mushroom into a 1up, but it'll still play the animation
$00:D18D	2 bytes	Mario physics	X-speed at which Mario enters/exits a horizontal pipe
$00:D18F	2 bytes	Mario physics	Y-Speed at which Mario enters/exits a vertical pipe
$00:D1AE	1 byte	Misc.	Animation frame for Mario entering horizontal pipe on Yoshi
$00:D20A	1 byte	Mario tilemap	Mario's pose for entering a vertical pipe (Default is 0F - facing screen)
$00:D229	1 byte	Misc.	Animation frame for Mario entering vertical pipe on Yoshi
$00:D231	5 bytes	Graphics	Change (A9 02 8D F9 13) to EA EA EA EA EA to remove Mario's priority when he's going down a pipe.
$00:D255	1 byte	Sound effect	Mario emerge from vertical pipe Sound Effect.
$00:D2BD	16 bytes	Mario physics	Mario's jump height. The earlier ones are when Mario is moving slowly (or standing still); the latter is when he's moving faster.
$00:D345	2 bytes	Mario physics	Mario 'acceleration' while walking and heading left
$00:D347	2 bytes	Mario physics	Mario 'acceleration' while running and heading left(added to the value for walking)
$00:D349	2 bytes	Mario physics	Mario 'acceleration' while walking and heading right
$00:D34B	2 bytes	Mario physics	Mario 'acceleration' while running and heading right(added to the value for walking)
$00:D5CA	30 bytes	Mario physics	How much Mario moves while on slopes, added to $7B. Values correspond to $7E:13E1 (slope type) divided by four. Every second byte is unused.
$00:D5E8	1 byte	Mario physics	X speed of player as he's floating in water freely in a level where a Layer 3 tide is active. (Does not affect the speed given when the player manually moves around on his own horizontally.)
$00:D5EA	1 byte	Mario physics	X speed of player as he's floating in water AND standing on a platform (like the floating grassy platforms) in a level where a Layer 3 tide is active. (Does not affect the speed given when the player manually moves around on his own horizontally.)
$00:D603	1 byte	Controller	Which button to press to duck. (axsptbrl). a = A/B, x = X/Y, s = Select, p = Pause, t = Top, b = Bottom, r = Right, l = Left.
$00:D604	1 byte	ASM	Change from F0 (BEQ) to 80 (BRA) to disable ducking.
Note that setting $01EB16 (0x0ED16) to [EA EA A5 73] (NOP #2 : LDA $73) is a good idea if you're using this.
$00:D61C	2 bytes	ASM	Change from 30 12 to EA EA to disable jumping.
$00:D63E	1 byte	ASM	Change from 10 to 80 to disable Spin Jump.
$00:D644	1 byte	Mario physics	[19] Change to [00] to allow Mario to spin jump while carrying an item. Because Mario spins so fast, the animation will not be smooth.
$00:D645	1 byte	ASM	Change this from "1A" to "60" to disable spin jumping. Unlike 0583E (SNES $00:D63E) from "10" to "80", changing this address does not make the "A" button do the regular jump, but it disables spin jumping altogether. This way, you can use the "A" button for something else without it jumping automatically.

Note: Still allows you to spinjump out of the water and dismount Yoshi.
$00:D64A	1 byte	Misc.	Spin Jump Sound, uses bank 1DFC.
$00:D65E	10 bytes	ASM	Mario jumping routine. (Sound effect + store to Mario Y speed.)
$00D65F (0585F) is the Sound effect for Mario jumping. (05861) is the bank for the sound effect. By default it uses $1DFA, but you can make it use $1DFC by changing (05861) to FC or $1DF9 by changing it to F9.
$00:D66F	1 byte	Mario physics	Change to 80 to disable Cape Flight and Jumping High while dashing. Interestingly enough, changing it to A9 will make Mario do a dash jump with every jump, even at a standstill, and will allow him to gain speed in the air.
$00:D674	1 byte	Mario physics	[D0] Change to 80 to prevent the player from flying with a cape. The player will still be able to float, cape-spin, and jump higher when running but will never "take off".

$04:9078	10 bytes	Misc.	The list of levels that have hard-coded paths. Each byte represents a level. The value 0xFF means to check for a particular overworld position instead of a level (for the pipe that Chocolate Island 2 leads to). Setting any of these levels to 0 will disable that hardcoded path.
$04:9082	4 bytes	Coordinate	The 16-bit X and Y position in the overworld that will be used for the hardcoded path from the pipe to Chocolate Island 2.
$04:9086	68 bytes	Misc.	This is a list of all of the hardcoded paths, in the same order as the levels defined in $04:9078. The paths are a list of the Layer 1 tiles that Mario would encounter along the path if the path were not hardcoded. Each path ends in a level tile of some kind, which matches a visible level tile in the world.
$04:90CA	68 bytes	Misc.	Hardcoded path information. For each tile in the list at $04:9086, there is a corresponding tile in this list. These tiles determine the facing of Mario while walking along that path.
$02: Down

$04:9264	1 byte	Misc.	On the overworld, Mario always faces you after he moves onto a level tile. Change the 09 to a 00 to disable that. Mario will continue facing the last direction he was moving towards after he moves onto a level tile.
$04:9291	3 bytes	Debug	If you replace this with "4C AF 92" (JMP $92AF), it will enable to walk in unrevealed paths on the overworld.
(But it will not work correctly with star road warps)
$04:9414	2 bytes	Mario physics	Speed of Mario on the OW (Higher = faster). First byte is normal ground, second is stairs.
$04:9426	10 bytes	Misc.	List of layer 1 overworld tiles that allow mario to walk from one map to another ("exit level tiles" in lunar magic)
$04:965C	1 byte	Overworld	Change to 80 (BRA) to make Mario stand on OW tiles 6A through 6D, instead of swimming through them.
$04:969F	6 bytes	Sound effect	Replace [A9 23 00 8D FC 1D] with [EA EA EA EA EA EA] to disable the "beep" when Mario moves onto a level tile.
$04:9885	65 bytes	Subroutine (JSR)	Calculator for the players overworld tile position. Before calling this function $00 must contain the 16 bit X position of the player, $02 must contain the 16 bit Y position of the player, and X must be 0 or 1 (luigi, mario). Additionally, A must be 16 bit.
$04:98CA	1 byte	Overworld	Initial Y speed of the player when walking up to Yoshi's house. Each frame, he moves up one pixel, and then he's moved down this many 256ths of a pixel. Since the default value for this is #$80, this means Mario moves up #$100-#$80=#$80 pixel 256ths, which is half a pixel.
$04:98F0	1 byte	Coordinate	At which Y position Mario should stop the intro march on the overworld (walking to Yoshi's house after start of new game). Default: $78.
$04:9964	170 bytes	Overworld	A big bunch of tables for which exits on the overworld lead to where.

$049964 to $0499A9: Five bytes for each entry that describe where each exit is (the tile Mario enters). First two bytes are Y position ($1F19), then comes X position ($1F21), then finally the submap ($13C3).
$0499AA to $0499EF: Five bytes for each entry that describe where each exit leads (the tile Mario ends at). Same format as above.
$0499F0 to $049A0D: Two bytes for each entry, to additionally describe the target. First comes Y high divided by 16 ($1F21), then comes X high divided by 16 ($1F1F).

If an exit is not present at the exact listed position, Mario is not moved, and tries to exit from the same tile again.
$04:9AC5	460 bytes	Layer 3	Level names.
It's almost raw tilemaps ready to be uploaded to VRAM (no YXPCCCTT), but if the highest bit is set, it gets cleared and it's the end of the area.
However, it's cut to small chunks. See $04A0FC (0x222FC) for how they're put together.
$04:9D22	2 bytes	Coordinate	Position of OW level names. Increase/decrease by 1 to make it move up to the right/left, increase/decrease by 20 to make it move down/upwards.
Note that #$8B should be considered the low byte for the address, not #$50.
$04:9EA7	162 bytes	Misc.	Two bytes per tile, starts at tile $01 and goes to $51.
First byte is X distance mario moves across tile
Second byte is Y distance mario moves across tile
The distance is based on walking right for a horizontal path
and walking down for a vertical path (see next entry)
$04:9F11	2 bytes	Overworld	[FC F8] Change to [10 04] to allow overworld path tile 36 to be used as the missing water path tile. Must be combined with $049FB3, $04A020, and $04A04D.
$04:9F49	162 bytes	Misc.	Two bytes per tile, starts at tile $01 and goes to $51
If the two bytes are $01,$00 then the tile is a horizontal path
If they are $00,$01 then a vertical path.
No other values were used in game
It seems odd to use two bytes to do this, so it might be worth experimenting with other values
$04:9FB3	2 bytes	Overworld	[00 01] Change to [01 00] to allow overworld path tile 36 to be used as the missing water path tile. Must be combined with $049F11, $04A020, and $04A04D.
$04:9FEB	81 bytes	Misc.	One byte per tile, starts at tile $01 and goes to $51
Mario pose while walking

0 - Mario Vertical
4 - Mario Horizontal
8 - Mario Swimming Vertical
C - Mario Swimming Horizontal
10 - Entering Level
14 - Climbing
18-FF - Unused

Only multiples of 4 seem to be used, using a value inbetween just seems to result in oddly animated versions of the normal values
$04:A020	1 byte	Overworld	[08] Change to [0C] to allow overworld path tile 36 to be used as the missing water path tile. Must be combined with $049F11, $049FB3, and $04A04D.
$04:A04D	1 byte	Overworld	[36] Change to [87] to allow overworld path tile 36 to be used as the missing water path tile. Must be combined with $049F11, $049FB3, and $04A020.
$04:A0FC	186 bytes	Layer 3	How to put level names together.
Format: 16 bits/entry.
First byte contains the offsets to the second and third parts (lowest four bits there is third part, upper four bits there is second), while the second byte (except the highest bit, which is unused) contains the offset to the first part.
Note that those offsets aren't direct, they point to $049C91, $049CCF, or $049CED (note: those offsets are 16bit), which contains the real offsets to $049AC5.
$04:A1B6	586 bytes	Empty	Unused data
$04:A400	307 bytes	Overworld border	Layer 3 Border Tile Data: The 95s, 96s, and 97s are the tiles used for the Mushrooms, Stars, and Fire Flowers (respectively). The overworld border's "filler" tiles (tile FE by default) are determined by bytes at: x22604 (top rows overworld border); x2260A (first column, left-hand side); x22610 (second column, left-hand side); x22616 (top right corner by map shadow); x2261C (right-hand side column); x22622 (bottom rows).
x22730 is the x beside Mario and the Lives in the overword border. Change from 8F to FE to remove it.

$04:DA1D	44 bytes	Misc.	22 bytes of layer 1 tiles, followed by 22 bytes of other layer 1 tiles to turn the first set into. this is how "future layer 1 tiles" work - tiles from the first list (most of which are blank) are transformed into tiles on the second list (level tiles and such).
$04:DABA	53 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	Subroutine that decompresses LC_RLE2 data.
$04:DBC8	7 bytes	Music	Music tracks used by the different submaps, indexed by submap ID ($1F11).

$04:E359	242 bytes	Overworld	Table that tells how many layer 2 tiles each event reveals and where in the table ($04DD8D) they start. This table contains 121 16-bit values; one for each event, and one to tell where $04DD8D ends.
$04:E453	285 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	Routine that loads the overworld layer 2 events on game load and OW load after cutscenes (possibly at every OW load).
$04:E577	16 bytes	Pointer	Pointer to locations in the routine that runs events.
$04:E5D6	16 bytes	Overworld	Which event numbers will trigger castle/fortress/switch palace tile destruction sequences. Due to a coding error by Nintendo, the table is treated as 0x18 bytes long when it's really only 0x10 bytes.
$04:E5D6	24 bytes	Overworld	Which event numbers will trigger castle/fortress/switch palace tile destruction sequences.
$04:E5E6	8 bytes	Overworld	The overworld tiles that will allow triggering a save prompt when an event has already been cleared. Tile must also exist in the list at $04:8F7F.

Byte 3 - X-Pos, high
Byte 4 - Y-Pos, low
Byte 5 - Y-Pos, high

Data is only read once, on titlescreen load. (Which also explains the bug that occurs with the titlescreen showing an unnecessary cloud tile.)

Must be combined with $05:87A4.

Warning: Does not have any effect on ROMs LM 1.7 has been used on.
$05:81BB	64 bytes	Misc.	Map16 tileset-specific table. Each bit (from high to low) corresponds to one tile. When the game sets up tile pointers, if the bit is set, it writes and then increments (by 2) P1 (which is initialized to the value at $058000 + (Tileset * 2)), otherwise it writes and increments P2 (initialized to $(0D)8000).
$05:82C8	114 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	This routine is used within the level clear to set $7EC800-$7EFFFF to #$25.
$05:833A	114 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	This routine is used within the level clear to set $7FC800-$7FFFFF to #$00.

$05:84B7	32 bytes	Misc.	Table containing the default YXPPCCCT sprite tile settings for each level mode. Stored to $64.
It's used for determining whether or not layer priority should work in a level mode; the value #$30 means that it won't work, while #$20 means that it will.
$05:84D7	4 bytes	Timer	Hundreds digits for the four time limits that can be specified in the level header. Default is $00, $02, $03, $04 for time limits of 0, 200, 300, and 400. Tens and ones digits are set to 0 at $05858A.
$05:84DB	1 byte	Music	Level Music - Here We Go! [02] (change to any other value to change what music plays by default in grassland levels)

$05:87A4	3 bytes	ASM	Same as $05:80D5. Both must be changed to the same values.
$05:8A95	2 bytes	Coordinate	Until which Y position (default : #$01B0) all Map16 tiles' graphics should be updated.
$05:8C85	1 byte	Objects	Which tileset's layer 2 always uses palettes 4-7, never 0-3. Default is 03 (Underground 1). To disable this effect, set it to anything invalid, like FF.
$05:8E19	487 bytes	Empty	Filled with FF.
$05:9000	135 bytes	Pointer	24-bit layer 3 pointer. 3 pointer addresses per FG/BG tileset (tilesets 0-E). First pointer for low and high tides, second pointer for low tide only, third pointer for tileset specific layer 3 (although technically, all layer 3 settings here can be tileset specific).
$05:9087	525 bytes	Layer 3	Layer 3 cage tiles placement, stripe image format.
$05:9294	693 bytes	Layer 3	Layer 3 crusher tiles placement, stripe image format.

$05:A563	29 bytes	Empty	Unused data
$05:A580	16 bytes	Layer 3	VRAM positions for the different lines of the message boxes. Actually the first half of stripe images; the second half is the same for all of those. It's at $05B1F7 (0x2B3F7).
$05:A590	23 bytes	Misc.	Which levels have message boxes. Different values here corresponds to $13BF. If the highest bit (#$80) is set, it tells that message 2 is used for that level; if clear, message 1 is used.
Most likely not used when LM is done with the ROM.
$05:A5D9	2,854 bytes	Layer 3	All the message box texts.
They're almost raw tilemaps (doesn't contain YXPCCCTT data) to be uploaded to VRAM, but setting the highest bit makes it add a newline too.
$05:B106	2 bytes	Misc.	Time when to show text after expanding/shrinking the Message Box window.

1st byte determines when to show the message.
2nd byte determines how fast to hide the message.

Edited values can't be higher than the default hex values.
$05:B108	2 bytes	Misc.	Expanding/Shrinking size of Message Box window.

Second digit of both bytes can't be other numbers than 0.
$05:B10A	2 bytes	Misc.	Expanding/Shrinking speed of Message Box window.
$05:B10C	399 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	The subroutine that displays the message from a message box. It handles the windowing HDMA, the stripe image upload, and things such as teleporting to the overworld after the intro screen.

$05B129/x2B329: [9C 9F 0D] Change to [EA EA EA] to prevent HDMA from getting disabled AFTER a message box has been displayed. Use with $05B296.
$05B15C/x2B35C: [8E] The Y position on which to start the march to Yoshi's House after the intro screen. To be used with $048F08/x21108.
$05B15D/x2B35D: [8D 19 1F] ASM code that stores the player's starting Y position to its RAM address, $1F19. Lunar Magic changes this to [EA EA EA] if you move the Mario OW sprite around, thus disabling the intro march (and its effects, such as storing '0' to the amount of levels cleared). If you want to undo this effect, change it back to [8D 19 1F].
$05B160/x2B360: Side exit subroutine. It can be JSL'd to.
$05B189/x2B389: [D0 CF] Change to [EA EA] to prevent the message that pops up in the intro screen from exiting the level. (It will act exactly the same as a message in any other level.)
$05B21D/x2B41D: [39] Tile properties of the Layer 3 tiles in message box messages in YXPCCCTT format. (Note: Lunar Magic ASM hacks render this address unused.)
$05B296/x2B496: [8D] Change to [0C] to prevent HDMA from getting disabled WHILE a message box is being displayed. Use with $05B129.
$05:B29B	64 bytes	Sprite tilemap related	This is the 8x8 tilemap data for the sprites used on the switch palace messages (dotted and '!' block). The first byte in each in the tile, the second byte is the YXPPCCCT data.
$05:B329	33 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	"Give coins" subroutine. If you JSL to it, it will give the player the number of coins equal to the value in A.
$05:B34A	17 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	Subroutine that gives the player a single coin. It handles the green star block as well.
$05B34E (0x2B54E) is the sound this generates.
$05:B375	488 bytes	Layer 3	Title screen stripe image data (the part that appears right as the title screen loads up).
$05:B6FE	203 bytes	Layer 3	Tilemap of the erase file select dialog. ("ERASE MARIO A . . . EMPTY", etc.)
$05:B7C9	169 bytes	Layer 3	Tilemap of the file select dialog. ("MARIO A . . . EMPTY", etc.)
$05:B872	85 bytes	Misc.	1 / 2 player game stripe image data.
$05:B93B	48 bytes	Graphics	Destination VRAM addresses for animated tiles. There are 6 bytes, 3 16-bit addresses, for each of the 8 possible animation frames (index = (frame & 7) * 6), and their values get stored to $0D7C, $0D7E, and $0D80 during the animation handling routine. (The last 6 bytes are actually unused, since SMW never uses animation frame 7 for anything.)
$05:B96B	24 bytes	Graphics	This table determines how a certain tile should vary its animation. 00 = always the same, 01 = change depending on $14AD, $14AE, or $14AF (P-switch timers and on/off switch), 02 = change depending on $1931 (FG/BG tileset number). It is indexed by the animation frame times 3, or (($14 & #$07) * 3), and each of the 8 possible animation frames uses one group of 3 bytes. Note that the last 6 bytes overlap with the table at $05B97D.
$05:B97D	15 bytes	Graphics	Table that determines, for tile animations that can have one of two states, which address to use to determine the state (i.e. any animation for which its corresponding value in the table at $05B96B is 01). The address used is $14AD plus this value, so 00 = blue P-switch, 01 = gray P-switch, 02 = on/off switch. This table is only 15 bytes long rather than 24 because all of the 2-state animations are updated on animation frame 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, never 5, 6, or 7. Note also that the last byte overlaps with the table at $05B98B.
$05:B98B	14 bytes	Misc.	Table, indexed by FG/BG tileset. Determines which group of animated tiles to use for a certain tileset, such as conveyor belts, stars, lava, etc.
$05:B999	416 bytes	Graphics	Frame data for animated tiles. Each group of 8 bytes is one set of tile animation, and each pair of bytes is one frame. The numbers are offsets forming the lower two bytes of pointers to the table data at $7E7D00. (For instance, the first two bytes = 00 95 -> data at $7E9500.) There seems to be no discernable pattern to which tiles are uploaded where in VRAM, though.
$05:BB39	109 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	The routine that handles tile animation. It reads the animation data from the table at $05B999 and, based on that and a few other factors (such as tileset and blue P-switch status), sets the pointers to the tile data in the table at RAM $7E0D76.
$05:BBA6	90 bytes	Empty	Unused data.
$05:BC87	30 bytes	Pointer	Pointers to the MAIN routines for the autoscroll sprites.
$05:BCF0	30 bytes	Pointer	Pointers to INIT routines for the autoscroll sprites.
$05:BEA6	3 bytes	ASM	[9C 11 14] Change this to EA EA EA to make Layer 2 Sideways Scroll not disable horizontal scroll.
$05:C4F2	6 bytes	ASM	Change from [85 22 A9 01 85 23] to [38 69 02 85 22 EA] in order to make the Layer 3 tides scroll to the right instead of the left. (Nothing is stored to the high byte of Layer 3 X position, however, so if you adjusted the tide to be asymmetrical, this may not give the wanted result.)

Only applies to the graphical part of the Layer 3 tide.
$05:C71B	1 byte	Misc.	Layer 2 on/off switch lower limit. The lower this number, the further down the screen layer 2 will go before stopping.
$05:C71D	1 byte	Misc.	Layer 2 on/off switch upper limit. The higher this number, the further up layer 2 will go before it will start descending again.
$05:C7BC	3 bytes	Misc.	Change to A9 08 EA and the background will start scrolling fast with generator F4 without having to touch platform C1
$05:CBFF	8 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	Jumps to Level End Scorecard Subroutine
$05:CC16	75 bytes	Layer 3	Start of course clear message tilemap.
$05CC1A (2CE1A) (10 bytes) is 'MARIO' tiles and attributes used in the end-of-level scorecard
$05CC28 (2CE28) (12 bytes) is "COURSE" and attributes at end of level scorecard.
$05CC36 (2CE36) (10 bytes) is "CLEAR" and attributes at end of level scorecard.
$05:CC61	5 bytes	Misc.	'LUIGI' letters used in the end-of-level scorecard (uses the same attributes as the MARIO letters)
$05:CC66	2 bytes	Misc.	Change to 80 1C to prevent the player from getting a free 1UP at the goal if the tens digit of your bonus star counter and the tens and ones digits of your time are all the same
$05:CC85	1 byte	Misc.	Change to 00 to disable "Course Clear" from appearing.
$05:CCC4	1 byte	Misc.	Number of LUIGI tiles to use in the end-of-level scorecard
$05:CD2C	1 byte	Timer	Time it takes for Bonus! to appear after hitting the goal tape.
$05:CD3F	35 bytes	Layer 3	Tilemap for the bonus star countdown in the end of level routine.
At 2CF5A, a second header starts for two tiles reserved for the top of the number of bonus stars received.
$05:CD62	20 bytes	Layer 3	Table of tiles used to display the amount of bonus stars received in the end level routine.
Starts with top tile of 0, bottom tile of 0, top tile of 1, bottom tile of 1, etc. Notably, there's no header OR end byte.
$05:CD79	1 byte	ASM	Changing this byte to [80] will disable the bonus counter in the 'Course Clear' screen.
$05:CDD8	1 byte	ASM	Changing this byte to [80] will disable the drumroll sound effect, and the Timer and score tallying at the 'Course Clear' screen.
$05:CDE4	1 byte	Sound effect	Drum Roll (tallying points) Sound Effect.
$05:CE7A	1 byte	Misc.	Time Multiplier for every second (use with 2D092) must be a multiple of 10.
$05:CE92	1 byte	Misc.	Time Multiplier for every second (use with 2D07A) must be a multiple of 10.
$05:CF1B	3 bytes	ASM	Change to EA EA EA and the player will receive no bonus stars at the end of the level.
$05:CF49	1 byte	Sound effect	Drum Roll Finishing Sound Effect.
$05:CFEA	22 bytes	Empty	Empty.
$05:D000	1,536 bytes	Misc.	Tile data for all Layer 1 overworld tiles, #$00-#$BF (but BF doesn't show up in LM no matter what you set it to). 8 bytes per 16x16 tile = 2 bytes per 8x8 tile. (TTTTTTTT YXPCCCTT.)
Order in which the pairs of bytes go inside a 16x16 tile: upper-left, bottom-left, upper-right, bottom-right.
$05:D608	96 bytes	Overworld	Which events are triggered by which level. Indexed by level ID, aka $13BF.
$05:D668	160 bytes	Empty	Unused data.
$05:D708	8 bytes	Level data	Layer 1, 2 (FG,BG) Initial Position. FG values (4 bytes) are first. BG values (4 values) are last.
$05:D710	16 bytes	Level data	Vertical scroll settings for layer 2 background. The values in this table are for RAM $7E:1414. The index to this table is the %ssss from the %ssssyyyy in table ROM $05:F000.
$05:D720	16 bytes	Level data	Horizontal scroll settings for layer 2 background. The values in this table are for RAM $7E:1413. The index to this table is the %ssss from the %ssssyyyy in table ROM $05:F000.

The maximum %ssss in SMW is %0111, thus indexes %1000 through %1111 are unused and are available if you want to invent more scroll settings for layer 2.
$05:D730	16 bytes	Level data	Mario Y-Position (main and midway entrances)
$05:D740	16 bytes	Level data	Mario Y-Subscreen Positions (main and midway entrances)
$05:D750	8 bytes	Level data	Mario X-Positions (main and midway entrances). 8th byte unused?
$05:D758	8 bytes	Level data	Mario X-Subscreen Positions (main and midway entrances). 8th byte unused?
$05:D760	6 bytes	Misc.	The tileset that each no-Yoshi intro intro is used with. Same order as $05D766 (0x2D966). The last one seems to be unused.
$05:D766	18 bytes	Pointer	List of 6 pointers to the "Get off Yoshi" level intros. In order: Ghost House, Castle Entrance 1, No Yoshi Sign 1, No Yoshi Sign 2, No Yoshi Sign 3, Castle Entrance 2.
$05:D778	18 bytes	Pointer	List of pointers to the Layer 2's for the "Get off Yoshi" intro levels. Same order as for 2D966
$05:D796	857 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	The main level data loading routine.
$05DAE5 is which level has the variable exits that changes depending on coins, timer, and yoshi coins. To disable the variable properties of this level, change $05DAE6 to 80.
$05DA19 is the start of the code for checking whether or not the level should use a No-Yoshi intro. Change to [4C D7 DA] to disable all No-Yoshi intros, including those for ghost houses and castles.
$05:DA1D	1 byte	Level number	Any level with a translevel number greater than or equal to this will use the "No Yoshi Sign 2" intro if the no-Yoshi intro is not disabled, regardless of tileset.

$05:DBAA	1 byte	Level number	Level number for yoshi wings bonus stage.
$05:DBAC	29 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	The routine that handles setting the level to warp to when Yoshi gets the wings. (Level xC8.)
$05:DBB3	1 byte	Misc.	Change to 60 (RTS) to make it so Yoshi wings use the normal screen exit instead of forcing a warp to level C8/1C8. This allows you to use pipes/doors in Yoshi wings levels. However, bonus games still remain incompatible. (Make sure to add a screen exit on every screen a player could possibly collect Yoshi wings if you use this.)
$05:DBC9	2 bytes	Coordinate	Position of lives counter on the overworld.
$05:DBF2	1 byte	Overworld border	[8B] Change to 6B to remove the OW life counter on the OW. Use with $04A530 (0x22730).

$05:F000	512 bytes	Level data	Table for each level in ssssyyyy format. ssss = layer 2 scroll settings, yyyy = Y position (from LM's method 1).
$05:F200	512 bytes	Level data	Table for each level in ttaaaxxx format. tt = tide/tileset specific Layer 3 BG to use, aaa = Mario action to start the level out with, xxx = initial X position (one of which is not selectable by LM, X = 10).
$05:F400	512 bytes	Level data	Table for each level in mmmmffbb format. mmmm = screen for midway entrance, ff = FG initial position, bb = BG initial position.
$05:F600	512 bytes	Level data	Table for each level in iuveeeee format. i = disable No Yoshi Intro flag, u = unknown vertical level positioning flag, v = vertical level positioning flag, eeeee = screen # that the primary entrance is on.
$05:F800	512 bytes	Level data	Part of the Secondary Entrance information; each byte is one of the secondary entrances. The byte is the low byte of the destination level number. The high bit (0x100 vs. 0x000) is stored in another table.
$05:FA00	512 bytes	Level data	Part of the Secondary Entrance information; each byte is one of the secondary entrances. The low 4 bits are the Y position for Mario; offsets into a table at SNES addresses $05/D730 and $05/D740. The next two bits are the FG initial position, indexing into the table at SNES address $05/D708. The highest 2 bits are the BG initial position, indexing into the table at SNES address $05/D70C.
$05:FC00	512 bytes	Level data	Part of the secondary level information. The low 5 bits are for the destination screen number. The high 3 bits are the X position for Mario; offsets into a table at SNES addresses $05/D750 and $05/D758.

$07:F1A0	10 bytes	Pointer	Relative pointers for each bonus star number formation's tilemap (0-9)
$07:F1AA	32 bytes	Misc.	Table of bonus stars to receive at the goal. The table is x20 bytes long, and each byte corresponds to a four-pixel range, from the lowest to the highest point. (The values in this table are binary-coded decimal numbers, so e.g. if the table says x17 it means you will get 17 (decimal) stars at that level.)
$07:F21A	1 byte	Sprite tilemap related	Tile used by Bonus Star formation
$07:F262	1 byte	Misc.	If you get this many bonus stars at the goal, you will also be awarded a 3up (default 50)

x3F47C: Winged Goomba 1656 value - change from 10 to 30 to make Winged Goombas "die when jumped on" (when jumped on, they will "die" and spawn a regular Goomba, just like the Paragoombas in SMB3).
x3F506: Sumo Bros. 1656 value (object clipping/table offset, can be jumped on, dies when jumped on, hop in/kick shells, disappear in a cloud of smoke).

$07:F7A0	50 bytes	Sprite Subroutine	The subroutine that loads the six Tweaker bytes for a sprite when it is initialized.
$07:F7D2	9 bytes	Sprite Subroutine	Resets most sprite tables and loads new values for some of them depending on the sprite number. Actually just JSLs to $07F722 and $07F78B.
$07:F7DB	512 bytes	Misc.	SMW's trigonometry/sine/cosine value table. Note that these are 16-bit values, but most of the high bytes are 00.
$07:F9DB	536 bytes	Sprite Misc.	Line-guided sprite speed table. These aren't speed values in the tradition sense: when using them, the low nybble of the sprite's X and Y position is cleared, and then it is offset a certain number of pixels depending on where it was before and which line guide it is on. The high nybble of each of these values determines how many pixels to move the sprite on the Y axis, and the low nybble determines how many pixels to move the sprite on the X axis. The pointers to these are at $07FBF3 and $07FC13.
$07:FBF3	32 bytes	Pointer	Low byte of pointer to line-guided sprite speed table, indexed by the Map16 tile number (76-95). The high bytes are at $07FC13, and the bank byte is 07.

$0B:FD0D	755 bytes	Empty	Empty space.
$0C:8000	3,328 bytes	Overworld	Tiles for layer 2 events. The first 0x900 bytes are for 6x6 blocks of 8x8 tiles, the last 0x400 bytes are for 2x2 blocks of 8x8 tiles.
$0C:8D00	1,642 bytes	Misc.	Overworld layer 2 event data's tilemap data: Tile properties (YXPCCCTT).

(Layer 2 events are what you see on the right of the overworld editor, in those blue X area)

Table is compressed in the LC_RLE1 format.

[FF FF] marks the end of the compressed table.
$0C:93B6	1 byte	ASM	Change to 0B to make Mario able to play the Yoshi's House level after the Yoshi's House scene of the credits gets over.
$0C:93C1	14 bytes	Pointer	Table indexed by $1928*2, which is used to indicate the cutscene number in the beginning of the credits (as in, castle = #$00, chocolate island BG = #$01, etc.). Points to BG image to use. All images are in bank $0C.
$0C:93CF	14 bytes	Misc.	Table indexed by $1928*2. Is used to clear certain bits of the loaded BG tile out, specifically, but not necessarily, the properties byte (YXPCCCTT) of the BG tile.
Some BG images in the credits require bit 8 to be clear ($FEFF).

$0C:9567	96 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	The DMA routine for updating the backgrounds during the credits walking sequence.
$0C:95C7	2,280 bytes	Layer 3	Credits text data.
$0C:9EB1	171 bytes	Subroutine (JSx FIXME)	The subroutine that uploads the credits tilemap.
$0C:9F6F	2 bytes	Misc.	Speed at which the Layer 2 background in the credits roll moves. [80] [FF]. It's actually a word address (#$FF80). Anything from #$8000-#$FFFF is left speed, anything from #$0001-#$7FFF is right speed.
$0C:9F89	2 bytes	Layer 3	How fast the credits scroll upwards. Word value. Default value is $0040 $0000-$7FFF is upward while $8000-$FFFF is downward.
(Note, when the credits end the situation will warp to Yoshi's House)
$0C:9FE7	3 bytes	Coordinate	Princess's Y position on Yoshi during the staff roll, relative to absolute value #$85. Each byte represents a Y position.

$0C:F7DF	2,048 bytes	Misc.	Layer 1 data on the overworld. Numbers are the same as in LM's "map16 editor".
The YI submap starts at $0CFBDE (67DDE) and is a simple format: One row of tiles at the time, 16 bytes for one line.
Level numbers are a little trickier, though:
Level numbers aren't anywhere in the rom. The loading routine assigns them when it runs. If you remove or add a level tile, you'll shift all of the levels after it. And the order of the tiles in the other submaps is even weirder, but if you look at the OW as 16x16 blocks and ignore submap borders, it'll start making sense.

$7E:0000	16 bytes	Misc.	Scratch RAM, is and can be used for a big number of purposes. The general purpose is temporarily preserving a value for later use in a routine.
Of note is the following address, used in LM ASM hacks:
$7E:0003 (16-bit) - Block number from LM Map16 editor. Also used in the custom Map16 tile change routine.
$7E:0010	1 byte	Flag	If the value in it is not zero, run the actual game; otherwise, loop forever. It's set to a non-zero value during NMI, and it's set to zero after the game mode has been run, so that the game runs exactly once a frame - one NMI trigger per frame.
$7E:0011	1 byte	Flag	Used to distinguish IRQ #1 from IRQ #2's code. (Inside the Morton/Ludwig/Roy room, where IRQ is used twice, although it can be used in other areas that run IRQ as well.) #$00 = IRQ #1; #$01 = IRQ #2.
$7E:0012	1 byte	Graphics	Stripe image loader - value must be divisible by 3.
A list of valid values can be found here.
$7E:0013	1 byte	Counter	"True" frame counter. Increments once per frame, except when the game is lagging. Note that $7E:0014 is better suited for most purposes.
$7E:0014	1 byte	Counter	"Effective" frame counter. Stops when, for example, RAM addresses such as $7E:009D are not zero (lock sprite flag, usually indicates the player is dying, grabbing a powerup, or something similar). Inside sprite code, this address is often preferred over $7E:0013, especially in graphics routines, as graphics will not be updated when the player dies if this address is used as an index to the tilemap.
$7E:0015	1 byte	I/O	Controller data 1. Format: byetUDLR.
b = A or B; y = X or Y; e = select; t = Start; U = up; D = down; L = left, R = right.

$7E:0026	2 bytes	Misc.	Depending on Layer 3 tides being activated or not, it's either:

Not activated:
Layer 2 X position minus Layer 1 X position.
Activated:
Layer 3 X position minus Layer 1 X position.

Used for various things, among which interaction with multiple layers is included.
$7E:0028	2 bytes	Misc.	Depending on Layer 3 tides being activated or not, it's either:

Not activated:
Layer 2 Y position minus Layer 1 Y position.
Activated:
Layer 3 Y position minus Layer 1 Y position.

Used for various things, among which interaction with multiple layers is included.

$7E:0034	2 bytes	Hardware mirror	Mode 7 matrix parameter D. Mirror of SNES register $211E.
$7E:0036	2 bytes	Misc.	Mode 7 rotation. Its values are calculated and stored into the respective Mode 7 parameter mirrors at $7E:002E through $7E:0035.
Values #$0000 through #$01FF are all different values, after that it's the same pattern - that is, if you add this 16-bit address with #$0200, there is a 360 degree rotation.
Furthermore, this address is used in the brown chained platform code as an index to the sine and cosine tables at $07:F7DB.
$7E:0038	2 bytes	Misc.	Mode 7 scaling; that is, making Layer 1 shrink or grow. Its values are calculated and stored into the respective Mode 7 parameter mirrors at $7E:002E through $7E:0035.
The first byte - $7E:0038 - is used for horizontal scaling, whereas the second byte - $7E:0039 - is used for vertical scaling.
Default value is #$20. The closer to #$00, the more the layer grows, the further from #$00, the more the layer shrinks. Value #$10 makes the layer twice as large as value #$20, value #$40 makes the layer twice as small as value #$20, etc.
$7E:003A	2 bytes	Hardware mirror	Mode 7 Layer 1 X position. Mirror of SNES register $210D.

4321 = Layer 1/2/3/4 uses 8x8 tiles when clear, 16x16 tiles when set; p = Layer 3 absolute priority (only in background mode 1); mmm = background mode # (0-7).
Mirror of SNES register $2105.
$7E:003F	1 byte	Hardware mirror	OAM Address, low byte. Also known as the mirror of SNES register $2102. High byte is at ROM $00:846B/0x66B. Is sometimes used to alter priority of various sprite tiles, such as with the sprite backgrounds in the boss rooms.
$7E:0040	1 byte	Hardware mirror	CGADSUB settings. Format: abcdefgh.
a = 0 for adding color layer, 1 for subtracting color layer; b = half-color enable; c = backdrop enable; d = object enable; efgh = enable Layer 4, 3, 2, 1 (Layer 3 is only affected below the status bar). Mirror of SNES register $2131.
$7E:0041	1 byte	Hardware mirror	Layer 1/2 window mask settings. Format: aaaabbbb.
aaaa = Layer 2 window settings; bbbb = Layer 1 window settings. Mirror of SNES register $2123.
$7E:0042	1 byte	Hardware mirror	Layer 3/4 window mask settings. Format: aaaabbbb.
aaaa = Layer 4 window settings; bbbb = Layer 3 window settings. Mirror of SNES register $2124.
$7E:0043	1 byte	Hardware mirror	Object and color window settings. Format: aaaabbbb.

$7E:0055	1 byte	Camera	Direction of scrolling for Layer 1.
#$00 = left (or up); #$02 = right (or down).
Used to index the various camera tables at $7E:0045 through $7E:0048 and $7E:004D through $7E:0050.

$7E:0058	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:0059	1 byte	Blocks	Used in the level loading routine as an indicator for the size of the object, or extended object type depending on what object is being loaded. Could be used as scratch RAM (except in ObjecTool and similar codes).
$7E:005A	1 byte	Blocks	Used in the level loading routine as the object number. Could be used as scratch RAM (except in ObjecTool and similar codes).

$7E:005D	1 byte	Misc.	Number of screens in level.
$7E:005E	1 byte	Camera	The last screen number (minus 1) before the camera stops moving horizontally. (Only applies in horizontal levels.)
$7E:005F	1 byte	Camera	The last screen number (minus 1) before the camera stops moving vertically. (Only applies in vertical levels.)
$7E:0060	4 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:0064	1 byte	Misc.	Properties (YXPPCCCT) byte for most sprites inside levels - including the player. Exceptions to this include sprites that mess with sprite priority in a different way, such as Piranha Plants, items coming out of a box (and inside the item box) and Net Koopas behind the nets.
$7E:0065	3 bytes	Pointer	24-bit pointer to layer 1 data - both level and overworld.
$7E:0068	3 bytes	Pointer	24-bit pointer to layer 2 data.
$7E:006B	3 bytes	Pointer	24-bit pointer to low byte of Map16 block data. Used during level load.
$7E:006E	3 bytes	Pointer	24-bit pointer to high byte of Map16 block data. Used during level load.
$7E:0071	1 byte	Player	Player animation trigger. A list of possible values can be found here.
$7E:0072	1 byte	Player	Player is in the air flag. This is set to a certain value depending on how the player got in the air in the first place, and in what state he is currently (rising or sinking).
This address is not affected by phases such as climbing. It is, however, also used in swimming animation.

Notable values:
#$0B = Jumping/swimming upwards.
#$0C = Shooting out of a slanted pipe, running at maximum speed.
#$24 = Descending/sinking.

The address in general is used in many instances.
For example, the game checks if this address is #$0C. If not, the player cannot ascend properly with the cape. Furthermore, the Layer 3 smash won't hurt the player if he's not on the ground (any non-zero value) and this address prevents the player from locking in place when still airborne during the Morton/Roy/Ludwig battle.
Also, when airborne, the value in this address appears to be stored to $7E:13E0, which also explains the otherwise odd values used for the different airborne phases.
$7E:0073	1 byte	Flag	Player is ducking flag. #$00 = No; #$04 = Yes. However, any value that is not zero also counts as 'Yes', SMW just stores that specific value to it.
$7E:0074	1 byte	Flag	Player is climbing flag. #$00 = No; #$1F = Yes. However, any value that is not zero will also mean the player is climbing - SMW always stores #$1F to it.
$7E:0075	1 byte	Flag	Player is in water flag. #$00 = No; #$01 = Yes.
$7E:0076	1 byte	Player	Player direction. #$00 = Left; #$01 = Right.
$7E:0077	1 byte	Player	Player blocked status - Used to check if player is blocked in a certain direction. Format: SxxMUDLR
The M bit means that the player is in the middle of a block.
The S bit indicates that the player is touching the side of the screens while horizontal screen scrolling is disabled.
UDLR = up, down, left, right (contact with walls).
$7E:0078	1 byte	Player	Used to hide the player partially or fully. Format: dlucapLU.
d = used in conjunction with all other set bits in order to disable processes such as the star timer decrementing.
l = hide lower extra player tile when in flight (hovering with the cape).
u = hide upper extra player tile when in flight (hovering with the cape).
c = hide regular cape tile.
a = hide attributive 8x8 tile.
p = hide extra player tile that is shown during the inflated P-balloon pose (does not apply if the player is small).
L = hide lower half of the body.
U = hide upper half of the body.
$7E:0079	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:007A	1 byte	Player	Accumulating fraction bits for player X speed (see code around $00:D792).
$7E:007B	1 byte	Player	Player X speed. #$7F is the fastest rightwards speed, while #$80 is the highest leftwards. +/-#$14 is fully walking, +/-#$2F is fully running. #$01-#$7F is right, #$80-#$FF is left, #$00 is standing still.
$7E:007C	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:007D	1 byte	Player	Player Y speed. #$00-#$7F = falling, #$80-#$FF = rising. #$80 is the highest upwards speed, while #$7F is the highest downwards speed. #$46 is the maximum fall speed, #$B3 is the normal jump speed, and #$A4 is the jump speed when fully running.
$7E:007E	2 bytes	Player	Player X position (16-bit), within the borders of the screen.
$7E:0080	2 bytes	Player	Player Y position (16-bit), within the borders of the screen.
$7E:0082	3 bytes	Pointer	Points to how steep the various slopes are and which parts of the slopes they represent. Points to $00:E5C8 in tilesets 0 and 7, and $00:E55E in others.
The table this one points to has one byte per block, from tile 16A to tile 1D7.
The value in these tables is then multiplied by 16, the lowest nibble of the sprite/player X position is added, and this is then used as an index to $00:E632 to tell how many pixels the sprite/player should move down from the nearest 16x16 tile.
$7E:0085	1 byte	Flag	Water level flag. #$00 = No; #$01 = Yes.
$7E:0086	1 byte	Flag	Slippery level flag. #$00 = No; #$01 through #$7F = Half-slippery; #$80 through #$FF = Yes. Possible values in the clean ROM are #$00 and #$80.
$7E:0087	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:0088	1 byte	Player	How long player goes into a pipe until he warps to another level.
$7E:0089	1 byte	Player	Actions to take when the player (Writing to it will only have effect if $7E:0071 is equal to #$06.)

#$00 = Enter a right-facing horizontal pipe.
#$01 = Enter a left-facing horizontal pipe.
#$02 = Enter a down-facing vertical pipe.
#$03 = Enter an up-facing vertical pipe.
#$04 = Exit from a left-facing horizontal pipe.
#$05 = Exit from a right-facing horizontal pipe.
#$06 = Exit from an up-facing vertical pipe.
#$07 = Exit from a down-facing vertical pipe.
$7E:008A	3 bytes	Misc.	Used for quite a number of things.

Altogether, it's a 24-bit pointer to the location of the compressed graphics files inside the ROM.

Furthermore, these addresses all appear to be used as scratch RAM. For example, solely $7E:008A is used as number of options to select in a blinking cursor menu.
$7E:008D	3 bytes	Misc.	This forms a 24-bit pointer to part of the decompressed graphics; starts at $7E:ACFE/F and keeps decrementing.
The three seperate RAM addresses have multiple purposes, however.
$7E:0090	1 byte	Player	Player Y position within a block. Calculated with $7E:0096 & #$0F. Indicates whether the player is touching the top or the bottom of the block.
$7E:0091	1 byte	Player	The direction to move the player out of a block.
#$01-#$07 are up, #$08-#$0F are down. Directly storing to it is ineffective as $7E:0090 will be used to overwrite it at $00:EE19.
$7E:0092	1 byte	Player	Player X position within a block. Calculated with $7E:0094 + #$08 & #$0F.
$7E:0093	1 byte	Player	The side of a block the player is on. It's set to #$00 for the right side and #$01 for the left side. This address is relative to the block the player is currently inside.
$7E:0094	2 bytes	Player	Player X position (16-bit) within the level, next frame (calculates player position one frame ahead, as opposed to $7E:00D1).
It's also used as a player X position on-screen on the overworld border.
$7E:0096	2 bytes	Player	Player Y position (16-bit) within the level, next frame (calculates player position one frame ahead, as opposed to $7E:00D3).
It's also used as a player Y position on-screen on the overworld border.
$7E:0098	1 byte	Misc.	Y position of block the player is touching, low byte. Also used in the creation of various sprite types/other blocks.
$7E:0099	1 byte	Misc.	Y position of block the player is touching, high byte. Also used in the creation of various sprite types/other blocks.
$7E:009A	1 byte	Misc.	X position of block the player is touching, low byte. Also used in the creation of various sprite types/other blocks.
$7E:009B	1 byte	Misc.	X position of block the player is touching, high byte. Also used in the creation of various sprite types/other blocks.
$7E:009C	1 byte	Blocks	Map16 tile to generate (used with $00:BEB0).
A list of valid values can be found here.
$7E:009D	1 byte	Flag	Lock animation and sprites flag. Most codes will still run if this is set, but almost nothing will move or animate.
$7E:009E	12 bytes	Sprites	Sprite number, or Acts Like setting for custom sprites.
$7E:00AA	12 bytes	Sprites	Sprite Y speed table.
$7E:00B6	12 bytes	Sprites	Sprite X speed table.
$7E:00C2	12 bytes	Sprites	Miscellaneous sprite table. In SMW, it's commonly used as a pointer to different parts of a sprite.
$7E:00CE	3 bytes	Pointer	24-bit pointer to level's sprite data.
$7E:00D1	2 bytes	Player	Player X position (16-bit) within the level, current frame (as opposed to $7E:0094).
$7E:00D3	2 bytes	Player	Player Y position (16-bit) within the level, current frame (as opposed to $7E:0096).
$7E:00D5	3 bytes	Pointer	Pointer to X and Y positions of Wiggler segments. Table at $7F9A7B.
$7E:00D8	12 bytes	Sprites	Sprite Y position, low byte.
$7E:00E4	12 bytes	Sprites	Sprite X position, low byte.
$7E:00F0	16 bytes	Empty	Used by Lunar Magic for various purposes.
$7E:00FE is the current level number plus 1 (so Yoshi's Island 1 would store #$0106 here). It's used for the custom palette loading code. #$0000 means that the custom palette won't be loaded (this is probably used for castle intros and/or credits).
The rest is unknown.

Originally, this address is empty, and it's cleared at reset, titlescreen and overworld load.
$7E:0100	1 byte	Misc.	Game Mode. A list of valid values can be found here.
$7E:0101	4 bytes	Misc.	Currently loaded sprite GFX files - stored in reverse order.
$7E:0105	4 bytes	Misc.	Currently loaded layer GFX files - stored in reverse order.
$7E:0109	1 byte	Misc.	When set to a non-zero value, the overworld loading routine is overridden by loading a level value stored here, minus #$24 if it's above #$24. For example, the intro level (level C5) is loaded this way by storing #$E9 to this address.
Depending on whether the player is on the main overworld or a submap, the level in question is either in the 0xx or 1xx area.
$7E:010A	1 byte	Misc.	Current save file number.
$7E:010B	245 bytes	Misc.	Stack. The first two bytes is the current level number in most hacks.
$7E:0200	544 bytes	I/O	OAM table - handles all sprite tiles that are on screen.
$7E:0310-$7E:0313 is for the player's upper half, $7E:0314-$7E:0317 for the player's lower half, and $7E:0318-$7E:031B is for the player's hand. Various tiles are documented here.
Note that $7E:0400-$7E:041F handles high bit of X position and tile size. It is not usable, since it is overwritten each frame and pretty painful to work with. Use $7E:0420-$7E:049F instead.
$7E:0420	128 bytes	Sprites	A table that determines the size of a sprite tile - 8x8 (#$00) or 16x16 (#$02). Each byte corresponds to four OAM bytes. Stores to $7E:0400-$7E:041F (where each two bits correspond to four OAM bytes.)
The lowest bit (#$01) is also used for the high bit of the X position.
$7E:04A0	448 bytes	Misc.	HDMA table for windowing effects, such as with the keyhole, level ending and titlescreen.
$7E:0660	32 bytes	Misc.	Gets overwritten by the HDMA table for the level ending circle. If the player gets above or below the borders of the screen, it can even run into $7E:0680 and beyond.
Otherwise cleared on reset and titlescreen load, but usage as empty RAM is definitely not recommended.
$7E:0680	1 byte	Palettes	Index to the palette updating tables, that are uploaded every frame.
#$00 = Use table at $7E:0682.
#$03 = Use table at $7E:0905.
#$06 = Use table at $7E:0703.
$7E:0681	1 byte	Palettes	Index to the table at $7E:0682 during the time when data is stored to this table in the lightning's, Magikoopa's and Big Boo Boss' code.
$7E:0682	19 bytes	Palettes	Uses for uploading palettes dynamically. SMW uses this in the lightning/Magikoopa/Big Boo Boss palette effects. $7E:0682 holds the amount of bytes to transfer, $7E:0683 holds the color number (stored to SNES register $2121), the bytes afterwards hold the actual color values transferred to the CGRAM. Further, this table may be indexed by $7E:0681 to add more color destinations. The format is the same as before, just at the new index.
This table doesn't actually have to end at $7E:0694, but SMW never goes beyond this. As such, the area after this address is listed as "empty".
$7E:0695	108 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
100 bytes used in LM 1.70+ for VRAM modification.
$7E:0701	2 bytes	Palettes	Background color. Used during gameplay in conjunction with $2132.
$7E:0703	512 bytes	Palettes	The entire palette. It is only uploaded to CGRAM during the level loading routine. Also used during overworld load, but not all of it.
$7E:0903	2 bytes	Palettes	Copy of background color $7E:0701/2.
$7E:0905	496 bytes	Palettes	Copy of palettes 0-F from $0703-$08F2. Only the first half of palette F is included. It is used in overworld path events fading in ($04:EAA0), and level ending fade in/out ($00:AF9D).
$7E:0AF5	1 byte	Empty	Cleared on reset and titlescreen load. Also cleared after a boss had been beaten - this can be disabled by changing [9C 5C 0A] at $00:B08D/0x328D to [80 01 EA].
$7E:0AF6	256 bytes	Misc.	Used for three different things:
1. Decompressed overworld graphics, animated tiles. For that it also cooperates with $7E:0BF6-$7E:0C55.
2. Iggy's/Larry's platform interaction. (16x16 tiles in a 16x16 square.)
3. Various tables for the Yoshi eggs at the credits, such as how much time must be waited until a new egg breaks, Y speed tables. TODO: Make Wiki page on this third note.

$7E:0D84	1 byte	Misc.	Used in Player Graphics DMA routine. This holds the amount of tiles to load. Is #$0A in levels (because of Yoshi) and #$06 on the overworld.
If it's set to zero, the player palette isn't reloaded. The presents screen makes use of that.
$7E:0D85	20 bytes	Sprites	16-bit pointers in bank $7E for uploading the player's, Yoshi's and Podoboo's on-screen tiles.
They're divided in two sets of 10 bytes, each two bytes being used for two 8x8 tiles.
The first 10 bytes are for the top half of each 16x16 tile (player's head, player's bottom, cape, Yoshi's head/Podoboo, Yoshi's bottom). The latter 10 bytes are for the bottom half of each 16x16 tile (same order).
$7E:0D99	2 bytes	Graphics	Holds the lower two bytes of the 24-bit RAM address (bank byte is $7E) of tile 7F's graphics; used during the player graphics DMA routine.
$7E:0D9B	1 byte	Misc.	Activates different level modes, depending on the following values:

#$00 = Mario; #$04 = Luigi.
$7E:0DD7	1 byte	Should be 00	An address that is expected to be #$00 throughout the entire game. $7E:0DD6 (current player) is sometimes used in 16bit mode, so using this address for different purposes is a bad idea.
$7E:0DD8	1 byte	Flag	Used to tell if the game is currently switching between Mario and Luigi or not.
#$00 = Not switching between Mario and Luigi.
#$01 = Switching between Mario and Luigi, during the fade-out.

$7E:0EE5	16 bytes	Sprites	Accumulating fraction bits for overworld sprite Z speed.
$7E:0EF5	1 byte	Overworld	This would be used to check whether the Koopa Kid should activate. Most likely it was used to prevent the Koopa Kid from triggering multiple times. Uses bits 5-7 only (#$80, #$40 and #$20). 
This address can be used as free RAM if you do not use the overworld koopa kids, it is cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:0EF6	1 byte	Overworld	Indicates which of the koopa kid triggers you are standing on. By default the tiles are: #$49, #$4A and #$4B. These correspond to index #$00, #$01 and #$02 respectively. This address is unused in the original SMW and can be used as free RAM, it is cleared on reset and titlescreen load.

$7E:0EF8	1 byte	Flag	Yoshi has been saved for the first time flag - used for Yoshi's thank message.
$7E:0EF9	55 bytes	Misc.	Status bar tilemap. A list of which byte goes where can be found here.

$7E:0F31	3 bytes	Counter	Timer.
$7E:0F31 = Hundreds.
$7E:0F32 = Tens.

$7E:0F4A	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table. Is used for the castle background flame's frame to display, as well as Boo ring's speed - #$00 = still; #$01-#$7F = counter-clockwise; #$80-#$FF = clockwise.
Is also used for several other sprites that are generated, such as the ghost ceiling, but not necessarily for the same purpose.
$7E:0F5E	20 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load. This table was probably meant to function as a cluster sprite table, but it was never used as such.
$7E:0F72	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table. Could be used for any purpose - in the original SMW, it holds the index of each individual Boo in a Boo ring (#$00-#$09). It is also used in the death bat ceiling to keep track of the bats' Y position.
$7E:0F86	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table, used for various purposes including determining which Boo ring is which and determining whether or not a particular "death bat" is visible.
$7E:0F9A	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table. Its purpose in SMW are the following: act as a timer for determining when death bats will fly, and as a timer to freeze an active Boo in the ghost ceiling.
$7E:0FAE	2 bytes	Sprites	Low byte of the angle of the Boo rings. $7E:0FAE is for the first Boo ring active; $7E:0FAF is for the second Boo ring active.
$7E:0FB0	2 bytes	Sprites	High byte of the angle of the Boo rings. $7E:0FB0 is for the first Boo ring active; $7E:0FB1 is for the second Boo ring active.
$7E:0FB2	2 bytes	Sprites	Boo ring center X position, low byte. $7E:0FB2 is for the first active Boo ring; $7E:0FB3 is for the second active Boo ring.
$7E:0FB4	2 bytes	Sprites	Boo ring center X position, high byte. $7E:0FB4 is for the first active Boo ring; $7E:0FB5 is for the second active Boo ring.
$7E:0FB6	2 bytes	Sprites	Boo ring center Y position, low byte. $7E:0FB6 is for the first active Boo ring; $7E:0FB7 is for the second active Boo ring.
$7E:0FB8	2 bytes	Sprites	Boo ring center Y position, high byte. $7E:0FB8 is for the first active Boo ring; $7E:0FB9 is for the second active Boo ring.
$7E:0FBA	2 bytes	Sprites	Offscreen flag for the Boo ring. If a byte is set to 01, the ring is offscreen and doesn't show up. $7E:0FBA is for the first Boo ring active; $7E:0FBB is for the second.
$7E:0FBC	2 bytes	Sprites	Boo ring index to level table (see $7E:1938). They are never erased, though, so they will always be reloaded.
$7E:0FBE	1,024 bytes	Pointer	16-bit pointer table, indexed by Map16 tile number*2. Points to the image to use for a certain Map16 tile. Usually starts with #$8000 or $9100 (levels) or #$D000 (overworld) and the value counts up with eight per two RAM addresses. Bank byte should be #$0D (levels) or #$05 (overworld).
$7E:13BE	1 byte	Misc.	Item memory settings from header.
$7E:13BF	1 byte	Misc.	Translevel number, set during transfer from world map to level. This identifies the first room of the current level. To convert this to a room number (the "level number" in Lunar Magic), if > #$24, then add #$DC.

The actual formula is more complex. If translevel number > #$24, then subtract #$24. Then check RAM $7E:1F11 or $7E:1F12. If the player is in a submap (not the big world map), then add #$100. The submaps of SMW use translevel numbers > #$24, and the big map uses numbers <= #$24, so the simplication is that #$100 - #$24 is #$DC.
$7E:13C0	1 byte	Should be 00	While this is never non-zero in the original SMW, $7E:13BF (level number) is sometimes used in 16bit mode. Using this address is thus not recommended.
To make this one become useful free RAM, change $05:D9C9/0x2DBC9 to [E2 10 AC BF 13 B9 08 D6 8D EA 1D] (header : lorom : org $05D9C9 : SEP #$10 : LDY $13BF : LDA $D608,y : STA $1DEA).
$7E:13C1	1 byte	Overworld	Current Layer 1 overworld tile the player is standing on.
$7E:13C2	1 byte	Should be 00	Cleared on reset, title screen load, and when walking onto a new overworld tile.
Note that it should remain at #$00 on the overworld, or various stuff will bug up.
$7E:13C3	1 byte	Overworld	Current player submap. #$00 = Main map; #$01 = Yoshi's Island; #$02 = Vanilla Dome; #$03 = Forest of Illusion; #$04 = Valley of Bowser; #$05 = Special World; #$06 = Star World.
Note that it is sometimes inaccurate. It is wiser to use $7E:0DB3 and $7E:1F11.
$7E:13C4	1 byte	Should be 00	An address that is expected to be #$00 throughout the entire game. $7E:13C3 (current player submap) is often used in 16-bit mode, so using this address is not recommended, unless you make sure it's cleared on overworld load. Is also cleared during the switch between Mario and Luigi. Furthermore, cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:13C5	1 byte	Counter	Increments each time a 3-Up moon is collected, serves no other purpose. (Its value is never loaded.)
$7E:13C6	1 byte	Misc.	Used by SMW's cutscenes. Goes from #$01 to #$08 and these values are in the order of the boss battles, e.g. #$01 = Iggy's castle, #$02 = Morton's castle. #$08 is the value used for the credits.
$7E:13C7	1 byte	Yoshi	Yoshi color. #$04=yellow; #$06=blue; #$08=red; #$0A=green. Refreshes on level change
$7E:13C8	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:13C9	1 byte	Flag	Show "Continue/End" menu flag.
#$00 = Don't show it; #$01 = freeze player, but don't load the text yet; #$02 = freeze player, load "Continue/End" menu.
$7E:13CA	1 byte	Flag	Show save prompt flag. It actually triggers when you get on a new level tile. #$00 = Show save prompt; #$01 = don't show save prompt.
$7E:13CB	1 byte	Misc.	This has been left out in the current SMW version.

When you hit a goal tape, and spawn a starman (which never happens), this is set to #$01. Now each time you switch an area in a level, this gets multiplied by 2. When this reaches #$80 (changed area seven times), you will start the area with the star power. The instruction which sets this address to #$01 is located at $00:FB5C/0x7D5C.
$7E:13CC	1 byte	Counter	The value you store here is the amount of coins that are being added up to the total. Usually, $7E:13CC is either #$00 or #$01, but it can be set to other values in order to add up multiple coins at once.
$7E:13CD	1 byte	Flag	If set to #$00, the midway point won't trigger if grabbed (it'll still make you big, but it won't set the midway flag). Never has any effect in the original SMW, probably left over from a beta.
$7E:13CE	1 byte	Flag	Midway Point flag.
#$00 = Midway Point not crossed; #$01 = Midway Point crossed.
$7E:13CF	1 byte	Flag	Used to override the castle/ghost house entrance cutscene after you collect the midway point.

#$00 = Show castle/ghost house entrance cutscene after collecting midway point.
#$40 = Don't show castle/ghost house entrance cutscene after collecting midway point. Note that any non-zero value will work, this is just what SMW uses.

Change $05:D9DE to #$9C to make the cutscene play regardless.
$7E:13D0	1 byte	Overworld	Index to what tile should be stored to VRAM during the castle/switch palace/fortress destruction sequence.
#$00 = Pressed green switch.
#$01 = Pressed yellow/red/blue switch.
#$02 = Destroyed fortress.
#$03 = Destroyed castle with exit.
#$04 = Destroyed castle without exit.
The tile data is then read from $04:EE7A through a 24-bit pointer at $7E:000A (scratch RAM).
$7E:13D1	1 byte	Overworld	Holds the value of the listed castle/fortress/switch tile that must be destroyed, by checking which event it uses (table at $04E5D6). For example, event #$06 (Iggy's Castle destroyed) makes this address hold value #$00 (it's the first slot in the table).
This address is then used as index to the address where the destroyed tile is uploaded to VRAM.
$7E:13D2	1 byte	Misc.	Color of the currently pressed switch palace, or #$00 for None. It's set to #$01 when the player hits a switch palace, and then set to the correct color (#$01 for Yellow, #$02 for Blue, #$03 for Red and #$04 for Green, others are oddly colored and/or flipped) by the message box routine. It creates both the ! blocks in the message boxes and on the overworld.
$7E:13D3	1 byte	Flag	Timer that disables Start from flipping the Pause flag when its value is not #$00 (thus, #$01-#$FF). If it is #$00, being able to press Start to get into the Pause mode is possible.
$7E:13D4	1 byte	Flag	Pause flag for levels, and "look around the map" flag for the overworld. #$00 = off; #$01 = on.
$7E:13D5	1 byte	Misc.	A flag that determines whether or not Layer 3 should scroll with the screen. If this is zero, Layer 3 will scroll depending on the tileset and tide setting; if it is any other value, Layer 3 will always be at the same position relative to Layer 1.
Also used on the overworld as accumulating fraction bits for player X speed (see $04:9801).
$7E:13D6	1 byte	Timer	Amount of time to wait until the score-incrementing drumroll begins when you beat a level. Any time you enter a level, this address is set to #$50. Once you beat the level and the number of bonus stars you won and the score is displayed (or just the score if you didn't cut the goal tape), this timer will decrement itself once per frame. Once it reaches a negative value or zero, the drumroll will commence. 
Once the drumroll ends, this is set to #$30, and then set to zero upon going to the overworld. It serves the same purpose after you beat a boss as well.
$7E:13D7	1 byte	Overworld	Y position fraction bits for the intro march (walking to Yoshi's House). It's in 256ths and increments with #$80 each frame; when it hits #$100 and thus overflows to #$00, the player is moved down a pixel. In addition to this, he's moved up a pixel every frame - making the player move up 1 pixel per 2 frames.
$7E:13D8	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:13D9	1 byte	Pointer	A pointer to various processes running on the overworld.

#$01 = Activate overworld events.
#$02 = Runs as soon as a level is beaten and the events have run.
#$03 = Standing still on a level tile.
#$04 = Player is moving in a certain direction.
#$05 = Runs before settling on a level tile.
#$06 = Fading out to #$07.
#$07 = Switching between Mario and Luigi.
#$08 = Fading in from #$07.
#$09 = Follows up #$08, sets $7E:13D9 to #$03.
#$0A = Switching between two submaps (not via warp pipe/star).
#$0B = Activate star warp.
#$0C = Player intro march (entering overworld for the first time).

Also used in the level end march:
#$00 = Show up the course clear text.
#$01 = Store bonus star text (if applicable), bonus stars not decrementing yet. 
#$02 = Count down timer/convert to score, add up bonus stars to total.
#$03 = Do nothing.
$7E:13DA	1 byte	Player	Accumulating fraction bits for fixed point player X speed.
$7E:13DB	1 byte	Player	Player walking frame pose. 

While walking, it gets the values from the table at $00:DC78, indexed by $7E:0019, which eventually becomes the player pose if the player does nothing else. The duration of each frame is read from $00:DC7C, though $7E:13DB plays no role in this. Note that this never is #$02 if the player is small.
$7E:13DB plays a role in determining which walking frame should be raised one pixel - see $00E35D.
$7E:13DC	1 byte	Player	Accumulating fraction bits for fixed point player Y speed.
$7E:13DD	1 byte	Player	Pose used when player is turning around. Uses same format as $7E:13E0.
$7E:13DE	1 byte	Player	Poses used on overworld map and during credits by the player. The animation uses three frames, namely: this value, this value + 1, and this value + 2.
Can also be used as a "Player is looking up" flag. That's cleared every frame, and it's set to #$03 when holding the Up arrow and standing still. The graphics routine is the only code that actually reads it.
$7E:13DF	1 byte	Player	Cape image. A list of valid values can be found here.
$7E:13E0	1 byte	Player	Player image/pose. A list of valid values can be found here.
$7E:13E1	1 byte	Player	Determines what kind of slope you are on. It's also set when flying with a cape. Possible values are:

#$00 - Not on any slope.
#$08 - Gradual slope left.
#$10 - Gradual slope right.
#$18 - Normal slope left.
#$20 - Normal slope right.
#$28 - Steep slope left.
#$30 - Steep slope right.
#$58 - Very steep slope left.
#$60 - Very steep slope right.
#$68 - Swooping down while flying and facing Left.
#$70 - Swooping down while flying and facing right.
$7E:13E2	1 byte	Player	Spinjump fireball timer. It increments every frame when the player spinjumps, if he has fire power. If the lowest four bits are clear, the player will throw out a fireball. The fourth bit (#$10) is the direction in which that fireball will move.
$7E:13E3	1 byte	Player	Player is wall-running flag.

#$00 = not wall-running.
#$02 = on bottom left (45 angle).
#$03 = on bottom right (45 angle).
#$04 = on top left (45 angle, on top of the wall).
#$05 = on top right (45 angle, on top of the wall).
#$06 = on the left wall.
#$07 = on the right wall.

Note that custom block codes will not run while wall-running!
$7E:13E4	1 byte	Player	Player dash timer. Increments with #$02 every frame the player is walking on the ground with the dash button held, otherwise decrements until it is zero. #$70 indicates that the player is at its maximum running speed, and also means that the player is able to fly with a cape.
$7E:13E5	1 byte	Misc.	This is the index used to get how many frames to store to the player animation timer, at $7E:1496. This is set to #$68 when the player is moving over a slippery surface.
$7E:13E6	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:13E8	1 byte	Flag	Cape spin interacts with sprites flag.
#$00 = don't interact; #$01 = do interact.
$7E:13E9	2 bytes	Player	Cape interaction X position within the level. It's adjusted when the cape attack is used.
$7E:13EB	2 bytes	Player	Cape interaction Y position within the level. It's adjusted when the cape attack is used.
$7E:13ED	1 byte	Player	Player pose on a slope when sliding, is set to #$1C.
This value is also negative (bit 7 set) when landing from flying, which allows the player to slide.
$7E:13EE	1 byte	Player	What kind of slope the player is on.

#$FC = Very steep slope left.
#$FD = Steep slope left.
#$FE = Normal slope left.
#$FF = Gradual slope left.
#$00 = Not on slope.
#$01 = Gradual slope right.
#$02 = Normal slope right.
#$03 = Steep slope right.
#$04 = Very steep slope right.
$7E:13EF	1 byte	Player	Player is on ground flag.
Is only set to #$01 if touching the floor, and ignores touching sides, ceilings, and running up walls. Does not work correctly in blocks, as the value still has to be calculated at that point. Instead, the original value of $7E:13EF is stored over to $7E:008D.
$7E:13F0	1 byte	Player	Used to calculate the index to the direction the player faces while using a climbing net door. The formula is $7E:149D << 1 & #$0E | $7E:13F0. This address gets its value from $7E:13F9.
$7E:13F1	1 byte	Flag	Vertical Scroll enable flag. #$00 = disabled; #$01 = enabled.
$7E:13F2	1 byte	Empty	Cleared on reset, titlescreen, overworld and cutscene load.
$7E:13F3	1 byte	Timer	When you get a P-balloon, this is set to #$09. Each frame afterwards, this is decremented until it gets to #$01, at which point the player will begin to show his inflated frame.
$7E:13F4	5 bytes	Blocks	A byte assigned to each row of blocks in the coin bonus game. Updated as blocks are chosen by the player to decide whether a life is given or not. If the value is #$FF, a life will be handed out. $7E:13F4 is for the uppermost row, $7E:13F5 for the one below that, etc.
$7E:13F9	1 byte	Player	Player goes behind layers flag.
$7E:13FA	1 byte	Player	Whether the player is capable of jumping out of the water immediately or not (so just below the surface). #$00 = No; #$01 = Yes.
$7E:13FB	1 byte	Player	Player is frozen flag. This includes controls and animation. Other sprites still move and can interact with the player, but contact with them should be avoided, as it would freeze the game. This may be useful for cutscenes to eliminate the jumping sound.
$7E:13FC	1 byte	Misc.	Currently active boss. Used for determining which graphics to load, as well as checking for various other purposes (like when the player should have priority over certain sprite backgrounds, that can be found in the boss rooms).
#$00 = Morton; #$01 = Roy; #$02 = Ludwig; #$03 = Bowser; #$04 = Reznor
Note that Iggy, Lemmy, Wendy and Larry don't make use of this. Cleared on level->overworld transitions, and possibly at other times too.
$7E:13FD	1 byte	Flag	When the L/R button is pressed, this address gets set to #$01 which briefly freezes the screen while the screen scrolls in whatever direction you pressed. It's cleared again when scrolling is done.
$7E:13FE	1 byte	Misc.	#$02 = scroll right, #$04 = scroll left. Used when L/R is pressed.
$7E:13FF	1 byte	Player	Player direction ($7E:0076) times 2. Used in the L/R screen-scrolling routine to determine when the screen will stop scrolling.
$7E:1400	1 byte	Camera	Controls if the camera should move to be at the proper place compared to the player. If this is set, L and R are ignored.
#$00 = normal case, don't move camera automatically, keep it in place (assuming L/R aren't used).
#$08 = move camera right.
#$0A = move camera left.
$7E:1401	1 byte	Timer	Increments with one each time one of the L/R buttons is pressed, until the timer hits #$10 (at which the L/R screen scroll is activated) or if the buttons are let go of.
$7E:1402	1 byte	Blocks	A flag that is set when the player is on a note block that is currently going down, i.e. the bounce sprite is moving downwards. If this wouldn't be set, the player would be pushed away from tile 152 (the tile that temporarily comes into place of the note block).
$7E:1403	1 byte	Misc.	Settings for current layer 3 tide.
#$00 - Not a tide image
#$01 - Water level changes
#$02 - Water level doesn't change
$7E:1404	1 byte	Flag	If "vertical scroll at will" is enabled, then this flag controls if the screen should scroll up to the player. If you set this to a non-zero value every frame, it can be seen as a temporary alternative to setting $00:F878/0x7A78 to #$80, since the latter is permanent.
$7E:1405	1 byte	Flag	Indicates that the player is just about to warp to another level via a pipe, and whether or not Yoshi should be drawn at that point. It is set as soon as $7E:0088 reaches zero, and if Yoshi is inside the warp pipe too, his graphics will be hidden.
$7E:1406	1 byte	Camera	This is set to #$80 if you bounce off of a springboard or a purple triangle (while on Yoshi, that is), and is cleared when touching the ground.
The game uses this, along with some other RAM addresses, to determine if the screen should scroll up with the player or not.
$7E:1407	1 byte	Player	Player gliding with cape phase.

#$00 = Not gliding.
#$01 = Gliding, rising.
#$02 = Gliding, staying on level.
#$03 = Gliding, sinking a little.
#$04 = Gliding, sinking more.
#$05 = Swooping down, initial phase.
#$06 = Swooping down, fast.

Controls player pose as well (table at $00:CE79).
$7E:1408	1 byte	Player	Used to index the cape gliding table at $00:D7D4 to see what the next step should be in the cape gliding phase. That value is (eventually) stored in $7E:1407.
#$00 = Make player rise.
#$01 = Make player sink (eventually swoop down).
#$02 = Holding off left/right button, make player sink, but not swoop down.
#$03 = Holding off left/right button, swooping down, make player sink less.
#$04 = Holding off left/right and X/Y buttons, terminate cape gliding.
$7E:1409	1 byte	Player	Keeps track of the furthest stage the player has been diving during flight. Possible values are:
#$F8: the stage when not holding the right or left button
#$F4: Partially aiming towards floor
#$F0: Almost completely diving
#$C8: Diving completely, the stage where you cause an earthquake where you land.

When set to #$C8, the player will gain the large upwards boost (instead of the little normal boost) when cathing air.
$7E:140A	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and during part of the cape flight routine.
$7E:140B	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load, cutscene load and level load.
$7E:140D	1 byte	Flag	Spin Jump flag. #$00 = normal jump (or on ground); any other value = spinjumping.
$7E:140E	1 byte	Sprites	Layer 2 is touched flag, which is used in the Layer 2 sinking/rising upon touch scroll sprite. #$00 = Layer 2 not touched; #$01 = Layer 2 touched.
$7E:140F	1 byte	Flag	Keeps incrementing in the Reznor battle room. It is used as a flag to determine that a different OAM index needs to be used for a smoke sprite or a puff of smoke, to make sure there's no conflict with the platform tiles.
However, since this keeps incrementing and thus sometimes hits #$00 again, it can occur that a platform tile disappears for one frame when a smoke sprite is shown.
$7E:1410	1 byte	Flag	Yoshi has wings flag #1 (the other is $7E:141E). #$01 would mean that the player with a fire flower powerup can shoot fireballs while on Yoshi (never occurs in the game), whereas #$02 indicates Yoshi has wings.
Note that this one only handles graphics of the wings (value #$02), and that it disables the Yoshi tongue action (value #$01).
The value from $7E:141E is stored here each frame.
$7E:1411	1 byte	Flag	Horizontal scroll settings from header flag. #$00 = Disable; #$01 = Enable.
$7E:1412	1 byte	Misc.	Vertical scroll settings from header. #$00 = Disable; #$01 = Enable; #$02 = Enable if flying/climbing/etc.
$7E:1413	1 byte	Misc.	Horizontal scroll setting for Layer 2. #$00 = none; #$01 = constant; #$02 = variable.
$7E:1414	1 byte	Misc.	Vertical scroll setting for Layer 2. #$00 = none; #$01 = constant; #$02 = variable; #$03 = slow.
$7E:1415	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and cutscene load.
$7E:1417	2 bytes	Camera	The distance to scroll layer 2 vertically if that kind of scrolling is enabled. This is calculated based on the type of vertical scrolling set in $7E:1414. The scrolling is calculated as follows:

If $7E:1414 is #$01 (constant), then $7E:1417 is: $7E:0020-$7E:001C
If $7E:1414 is #$02 (variable), then $7E:1417 is: $7E:001C >> 1 ^ #$FFFF + 1 + $7E:0020
If $7E:1414 is #$03 (slow), then $7E:1417 is: $7E:001C >> 3 ^ #$FFFF + 1 + $7E:0020
$7E:1419	1 byte	Sprites	How Yoshi should go inside a pipe.
#$01 = Duck a little (horizontal pipe).
#$02 = Face the screen (vertical pipe).
#$FF = Don't change image, only go behind layer (shooting out of slanted pipe). Note that this will probably work with all values #$03-#$FF.

An immediate effect of this is that Yoshi goes beyond layer 1 with any non-zero value. Also, Yoshi's tongue isn't shown either.
$7E:141A	1 byte	Counter	Counter that increments every time a new level is entered (with a door or pipe) - this enables you to distinguish the 'mother'-level from sublevels, as this always is zero at the start of a level. Note: Don't enter a sublevel within a level 256 times, or a glitch will occur.
$7E:141B	1 byte	Flag	Determines if you have played the bonus game before in the same level before. If it is non-zero (meaning you've played the game before), all blocks in the coin game will always be incorrect.
Note that if you don't hit a single block the first time playing the game, then this will be zero, and you can play the game again.
$7E:141C	1 byte	Flag	Secret goal sprite flag. Is not checked in vertical levels.
$7E:141D	1 byte	Flag	Whether "Mario/Luigi Start!" should be shown or not. Used for castle entrances and the likes.
#$00 = enable; #$01 = disable.
$7E:141E	1 byte	Yoshi	Yoshi has wings flag. The only possible value for this address in the original is #$02, but setting to #$01 will allow the player to throw fireballs if on Yoshi, even if he is not fiery. This will, however, disable flight as well as Yoshi's tongue attack.
It's recalculated each frame.
$7E:141F	1 byte	Flag	Disable No Yoshi Intro flag.
#$00 = regular behavior (depending on the tileset, the No Yoshi Intro is either shown or not).
#$80 = the No Yoshi Intro is disabled, regardless of tileset.
$7E:1420	1 byte	Counter	Yoshi Coins collected. Does not affect amount of Yoshi Coins on status bar.
$7E:1421	1 byte	Counter	Counter used by the invisible 1-Up checkpoints. Starts at zero, and increments with one every time the next checkpoint has been touched. Resets to zero when a checkpoint has been touched that can't be checked yet, for example checkpoint #2 when #1 hasn't been touched yet.
$7E:1422	1 byte	Counter	Amount of Yoshi Coins to display on the status bar. Values #$01 through #$04 are the values where it will display that number of Yoshi Coins, otherwise none are displayed.
$7E:1423	1 byte	Misc.	Indicates which switch palace switch is being pressed.
Its value also varies depending on which side of the switch was pressed. (Left side -> it uses the first value, right side -> it uses the second.)
01/02 = green, 05/06 = yellow, 09/0A = blue, 0D/0E = red.
The bottom halves also set this, but this doesn't trigger anything.
$7E:1424	1 byte	Timer	Used to determine whether or not the victory walk should display the number of collected bonus stars. If it is zero (see also $7E:1900), the amount of collected bonus stars is not displayed. Otherwise, it is. $7E:1900 is stored to it, causing this address to decrement as well. Also note that this value does NOT have any effect on the rest of the bonus text.
$7E:1425	1 byte	Flag	Bonus game flag. If anything non-zero, the bonus game will commence after the level has been cleared.
$7E:1426	1 byte	Misc.	Message box trigger. #$00 = none; #$01 = message 1; #$02 = message 2; #$03 = Yoshi thanks message.

$7E:142A	2 bytes	Player	Where the player has to be on the screen in order to justify moving the screen. If the player X position relative to the screen is less than $142A - #$000C, then the screen will move left. If the player X position relative to the screen is greater than or equal to $142A + #$000C, the screen will move right.
$7E:142C	4 bytes	Camera	Two 16-bit addresses, $142C and $142E, are set to $142A - #$000C and $142A + #$000C respectively during the screen-scrolling routine, read from to determine whether or not to scroll the screen.

$7E:1432	1 byte	Flag	Directional coin activation flag. This is set to #$01 when the sprite changes the music, and it is used to prevent the player being able to spawn any more than one instance of the sprite in an entire level, as it carries across sublevels.
$7E:1433	1 byte	Timer	Scaling factor of the circle for the windowing HDMA effects used with the titlescreen, level ending and keyhole.
The closer to zero, the smaller the circle.
Loads titlescreen when value becomes #$F0 or higher.
$7E:1434	1 byte	Timer	Set to #$30 to end level via keyhole. Works as a timer of some sorts, to indicate how long the keyhole sequence should last - but in SMW, this value is never set to anything other than #$00 or #$30. Also, this address freezes player and sprites by storing its value to $7E:13FB, resp. $7E:009D.
$7E:1435	1 byte	Flag	Keyhole growing/shrinking flag. #$00 = growing; #$01 = shrinking.
$7E:1436	2 bytes	Misc.	Used for multiple purposes.

Keyhole X position when keyhole sequence is activated. It's also used in the Iggy/Larry boss fight, where it controls the player X position when on the ground.
Additionally, related to the switch block overworld event, purpose yet unknown.
$7E:1438	2 bytes	Sprites	Used for multiple purposes.

Keyhole Y position when keyhole sequence is activated. It's also used in the Iggy/Larry boss fight, where it controls the player Y position when on the ground.
Additionally, related to the switch block overworld event, purpose yet unknown.
$7E:143A	1 byte	Flag	When set to a value that is not zero, this will make the game overwrite tiles #$00 through #$05, #$10 through #$15, #$4A through #$4F and #$5A through #$5F with data it gets from $7F:977B-$7F:9A7A. These are uploaded during V-blank (NMI).
Is used to write the graphics for "MARIO START!", "LUIGI START!", "TIME UP!", "GAME OVER" and "BONUS GAME".
$7E:143B	1 byte	Misc.	Which death message must be displayed. #$14 = "GAME OVER"; #$1D = "TIME UP!".
$7E:143C	1 byte	Timer	Death message animation timer. Amount of time until the two segments come together, such as with "GAME OVER", where the animation goes like this: GAME --> <-- OVER.
Is set to #$C0, decrements by four at a time.
$7E:143D	1 byte	Timer	Timer for the "TIME UP!"/"GAME OVER" death message - how long it should stay active after the two words have come together. Is set to #$FF, decrements by one at a time.
$7E:143E	1 byte	Sprites	Scroll command number. A list of possible values can be found here.
$7E:143F	1 byte	Sprites	Scroll command number used on layer two. This address serves as a complement to $7E:143E. This address is set by the init routine of the layer one of each scroll address.
$7E:1440	1 byte	Sprites	The starting Y-position of the current scroll sprite, left-shifted twice and with the extra bits still added. (Format: --YYYYEE, where Y = Y position and EE = extra bits).
Regularly adjusted inside the scroll sprites. It can be particularly useful for determining what type of scrolling should be applied with this scroll sprite.
This address is used for Layer 1 scrolling.

#$04 = Yoshis jump in excitement, then screen fades out.
24-bit pointers for these actions are located at SNES $0C:A1DE.

Also used in the castle destruction sequence as a pointer to what actions should be taken. Each castle destruction has its own pointer table for this address. $0C:C9A5 is a pointer table which points the the pointer tables of each castle. You can view the breakdown of each sequence here.

Used in scroll sprites for tracking what type of scroll it is currently doing, usually depending on $7E:1440/$7E:1441. This is the Layer 1 counterpart of $7E:1443.
$7E:1443	1 byte	Sprites	Used in scroll sprites for tracking what type of scroll it is currently doing, usually depending on $7E:1440/$7E:1441. This is the Layer 2 counterpart of $7E:1442.

It's also a castle destruction sequence text timer. Starts at #$FF when the 'Welcome' music starts, and a new line of text appears every #$20 frames after that. (#$DF, #$BF, #$9F, etc.)
$7E:1444	1 byte	Sprites	Layer 1 scroll command pointer/timer. This timer serves no defined purpose on itself, but is generally used for waiting a specific number of frames before updating scroll properties such as speed. For example, with the Layer 1 auto-scroll, this value being #$00 indicates the auto-scroll has finished.
$7E:1445	1 byte	Sprites	Layer 2 scroll command pointer/timer. This timer serves no defined purpose on itself, but is generally used for waiting a specific number of frames before updating scroll properties such as speed.
$7E:1446	2 bytes	Sprites	Layer 1 X speed used in the scrolling codes.
#$0001-#$7FFF = move left; #$8000-#$FFFF = move right. #$0000 means there is no movement.
Effectively, it's the X speed to give the player when he's touching the side of a screen, during a level which does not have regular Layer 1 scrolling. Values are different depending on the type of (auto-)scroll.
This value divided by #$10/#16 is stored into $7E:007B.
$7E:1448	2 bytes	Sprites	Layer 1 Y speed used in the scrolling codes.
#$0001-#$7FFF = move upwards; #$8000-#$FFFF = move downwards. #$0000 means there is no movement.

$7E:144C	2 bytes	Sprites	Layer 2 Y speed used in the scrolling codes, particularly in the Layer 2 scroll command (sprite EA).
#$0001-#$7FFF = move upwards; #$8000-#$FFFF = move downwards. #$0000 means there is no movement.

$7E:144D also controls the time until you can press a button to end the castle destruction sequence (after all text has been generated on-screen).
$7E:144E	2 bytes	Sprites	This is used internally by the scroll sprites for updating the layer 1 X position. In particular, the routine at $05:C4F9 uses it to add the current speed to.

Furthermore, $7E:144E is used on the overworld to determine after how many frames the player should face the screen again after settling on a level tile.

$7E:144E is also used in the credits, as a timer that is set to #$06 and decrements every frame. If this is zero, bit 0 of $7E:144F will get flipped, causing Peach's image during the walking phase to bounce.

$7E:144F is a flag that makes Peach bounce during the time she walks in the credits.
#$00 = Peach frame 1, upright; #$01 = Peach frame 2, one pixel lower.
$7E:1450	2 bytes	Sprites	This is used internally by the scroll sprites for updating the layer 1 Y position. In particular, the routine at $05:C4F9 uses it to add the current speed to.
$7E:1452	2 bytes	Sprites	This is used internally by the scroll sprites for updating the layer 2 X position. In particular, the routine at $05:C4F9 uses it to add the current speed to.
$7E:1454	2 bytes	Sprites	This is used internally by the scroll sprites for updating the layer 2 Y position. In particular, the routine at $05:C4F9 uses it to add the current speed to.
$7E:1456	1 byte	Sprites	Used by the scroll sprites as an index for what layer to process. #$00 is Layer 1, and #$04 is Layer 2. The RAM addresses indexed include the entire area of $7E:1446-$7E:1455.
$7E:1457	1 byte	Flag	This flag is set and used to determine whether to upload the multicolor Yoshis in the ending cutscene. The surprised Yoshi image (when the eggs are hatching) will appear regardless of this address, but the jumping Yoshi images require this flag to be #$01.
If anything else, they will not be drawn on-screen.
$7E:1458	2 bytes	Misc.	Used in the Layer 3 images to control the X speed of Layer 3. This address is primarily used for the tileset specific images (not #$01 or #$03), for example the goldfish and the ghost house fog.
$7E:145A	2 bytes	Misc.	Used in the Layer 3 images to control the Y speed of Layer 3. This address is used primarily for the rising/falling Layer 3 tide.
$7E:145C	2 bytes	Misc.	This is used internally by Layer 3 images for updating the Layer 3 X position, which is used in (for example) the goldfish and ghost house fog.
It's also used as accumulating fraction bits for the Layer 3 Y speed during the rising/sinking Layer 3 tide.

$7E:145D is also used as a timer to determine when to move to the next game mode after the Yoshi house credits scene. Is set to #$F0 the moment all eggs hatched.
$7E:145E	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and cutscene load.
$7E:1460	1 byte	Flag	Layer 3 vertical scrolling direction. #$00 = downwards; #$01 = upwards.
$7E:1461	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and cutscene load.
This byte functions as the "high byte" of $7E:1460. SMW does not actually use this byte, however it is overwritten during level load (see $05:BE92).
Cleared on reset, titlescreen, overworld, level (with the exception of boss rooms) and cutscene load.
$7E:1462	2 bytes	Misc.	Layer 1 X position.
Much similar to $7E:001A, maintaining the exact same values, with the difference being the usage of their values.
This is more notable in auto-scroll commands, for example, if $7E:1462 were to remain static while there was a Layer 2 auto-scroll going, the image would stay, but the level would move.
Is also used for temporary storage to determine how much the screen has moved horizontally in the current frame. ($7E:001A - $7E:1462 = $7E:17BC)
$7E:1464	2 bytes	Misc.	Layer 1 Y position.
Much similar to $7E:001C.
Is also used for temporary storage to determine how much the screen has moved vertically in the current frame. ($7E:001C - $7E:1464 = $7E:17BD)
$7E:1466	2 bytes	Misc.	Layer 2 X position.
Much similar to $7E:001E.
Is also used for temporary storage to determine how much the screen has moved horizontally in the current frame. ($7E:001E - $7E:1466 = $7E:17BE)
$7E:1468	2 bytes	Misc.	Layer 2 Y position.
Much similar to $7E:0020.
Is also used for temporary storage to determine how much Layer 2 has moved vertically in the current frame. ($7E:0020 - $7E:1468 = $7E:17BF)
$7E:146A	2 bytes	Misc.	Used to determine how much layer 3 has moved horizontally in the current frame. This address is only used during the credits while displaying the enemies for the windowing HDMA.
$7E:146C	4 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and cutscene load.
$7E:1470	1 byte	Flag	Carrying something flag. Very similar to $7E:148F, with the difference that, if this flag is set, the player's graphics don't change, and throw blocks can still be picked up as long as $7E:148F remains zero. If used in a carryable custom sprite to check if the player is already carrying something, definitely combine it with $7E:148F to assure there are no exceptions.
#$00 = Carrying nothing; #$01 = carrying something.
$7E:1471	1 byte	Misc.	Whether the player is on top of a solid sprite, and what kind of sprite that is.

#$01 = Standing on top of a floating rock, floating grass platform, floating skull, Mega Mole, carrot top lift, etc. This one calculates the player's position based on the next frame.
#$02 = Standing on top of a springboard, pea bouncer. This one calculates the player's position based on the next frame.
There's a check at $00:D60B so that the player can hold the jump button pressed for a longer while to jump higher.
#$03 = Standing on top of a brown chained platform, gray falling platform. This one calculates the player's position based on the current frame.
$7E:1472	1 byte	Sprites	Left window X position of the top of the spotlight. It's always #$78. This is the value stored that is stored to $7E:147A every four frames.
$7E:1473	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1474	1 byte	Sprites	Right window X position of the top of the spotlight. It's always #$87. This is the value that is stored to $7E:147C every four frames.
$7E:1475	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1476	1 byte	Sprites	Left window X position of the extreme bottom of the spotlight.
Please note that this position is for the imaginary scanline #$FF, whereas there are normally only #$E0 scanlines on a screen.
That means that the value here is never equal to the left window X position on the very bottom of the screen, unless $7E:1476 is equal to $7E:1472, forming a straight vertical line.
$7E:1477	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1478	1 byte	Sprites	Right window X position of the extreme bottom of the spotlight.
Please note that this position is for the imaginary scanline #$FF, whereas there are normally only #$E0 scanlines on a screen.
That means that the value here is never equal to the right window X position on the very bottom of the screen, unless $7E:1478 is equal to $7E:1474, forming a straight vertical line.
$7E:1479	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:147A	1 byte	Sprites	In the spotlight code, the left window X position of each scanline is calculated and temporarily stored here, after which this address stores its value to an even byte of $7E:04A0.
What is left at the end of every frame is the left window X position on the very bottom scanline.
This is used once in every four frames, probably to reduce lag.
$7E:147B	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:147C	1 byte	Sprites	In the spotlight code, the right window X position of each scanline is calculated and temporarily stored here, after which this address stores its value to an odd byte of $7E:04A0.
What is left at the end of every frame is the right window X position on the very bottom scanline.
This address used once in every four frames, probably to reduce lag.
$7E:147D	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:147E	1 byte	Sprites	Used by the spotlight to calculate whether or not to move the left window on a particular scan line into the direction of the resulting X position on the bottom left.
It works by adding the width from $7E:1480 to itself (starting at #$00 initially), and if the resulting value is higher than #$CF (or even overflows, setting the carry bit), the left window moves a pixel into the direction of the resulting X position on the bottom left.
$7E:147F	1 byte	Sprites	Used by the spotlight to calculate whether or not to move the right window on a particular scan line into the direction of the resulting X position on the bottom right.
It works by adding the width from $7E:1481 to itself (starting at #$00 initially), and if the resulting value is higher than #$CF (or even overflows, setting the carry bit), the right window moves a pixel into the direction of the resulting X position on the bottom right.
$7E:1480	1 byte	Sprites	Width between the top left window ($7E:1472) and the bottom left window ($7E:1476) of the spotlight. This value is always positive, and its sign flag is saved at $7E:1484.
$7E:1481	1 byte	Sprites	Width between the top right window ($7E:1474) and the bottom right window ($7E:1478) of the spotlight. This value is always positive, and its sign flag is saved at $7E:1485.
$7E:1482	1 byte	Flag	Used as a flag in the spotlight code to skip initialization of the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right RAM addresses.
#$00 = Run initialization; #$01 = Do not run initialization.
$7E:1483	1 byte	Sprites	Used as a flag for the current direction the spotlight is moving. #$00 = spotlight is moving right; #$01 = spotlight is moving left.
$7E:1484	1 byte	Sprites	A flag used in the spotlight code to determine which side of the top left window border the bottom left window border is on.
#$00 = bottom left is more to the left; #$01 = bottom left is on the same position, or more to the right.
$7E:1485	1 byte	Sprites	A flag used in the spotlight code to determine which side of the top right window border the bottom right window border is on.
#$00 = bottom right is more to the left; #$01 = bottom right is on the same position, or more to the right.
$7E:1486	1 byte	Sprites	Unused, set to #$01 in the dark room spotlight sprite. Change $03:C544 to EA EA EA (NOP #3) to change this into free RAM. If that patch is performed, this address is safe for other uses. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and cutscene load.
$7E:1487	4 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:148B	2 bytes	Misc.	Used by random number generation subroutine to determine the next output.
Do not use these if you want a random number. Use $7E:148D instead.
$7E:148D	2 bytes	Misc.	Output of random number generation routine, located at $01:ACF9/0x0AEF9.
$7E:148F	1 byte	Player	Flag used to detect if the player is holding an object (throw block, key, shell, etc.) Also adjusts the player image, different from $7E:1470. This address does store its value to $7E:1470.
If the player is carrying something, this address should usually (not always, regarding the glitch) prevent the player from holding a second item.
#$00 = Carrying nothing; #$01 = carrying something.
$7E:1490	1 byte	Timer	Star power timer.
$7E:1491	1 byte	Sprites	Amount of pixels on the X/Y axis a sprite has moved in the current frame. It is set after every call to update sprite position based on speed, and the routine that updates both X/Y position based on speed will leave $7E:1491 with the movement on the X axis in this address. Very often used for rideable sprites as this address can be added to the player position to move the player in tandem with the sprite.
$7E:1492	1 byte	Timer	Player peace image timer.
$7E:1493	1 byte	Timer	End level timer. Setting to #$FF will end the level as a goal sphere / boss fight. Peace sign is shown here when the timer hits #$28. The switches (yellow, green, red and blue) set it to #$08.
$7E:1494	1 byte	Palettes	Direction of the color fading at level end. Only the highest bit is ever read.
#$00 = getting darker; #$80 = getting brighter.
$7E:1495	1 byte	Timer	Timer that controls fading and the level end scorecard. Increments and stops when it hits #$40. While it's ticking, the colors will fade; when it's done, $7E:003A through $7E:003D won't be read and the Layer 3 scrolling will be locked.
$7E:1496	1 byte	Timer	Player animation timer. This controls a lot of things such as the walking/running animation rate, how long the death animation should last, how long to stay invisible for after getting the cape, the alternating player images when the player is walking over slippery surfaces, etc.
$7E:1497	1 byte	Timer	Flashing invulnerability timer - not to be confused with the star timer. This is activated when the player gets hurt. Controls both interaction (player should not interact with sprites again) as well as the blinking graphics.
$7E:1498	1 byte	Timer	Time to show player picking an item/object up pose.
$7E:1499	1 byte	Timer	Time for player to face the screen.
$7E:149A	1 byte	Timer	Time to show player kicking something pose.
$7E:149B	1 byte	Timer	Time for the player to change through palettes, as if he got a fire flower. Only ticks when the "get flower" animation is active, and is just a flag otherwise.
$7E:149C	1 byte	Timer	Time to show player shooting a fireball pose.
$7E:149D	1 byte	Timer	Side flipping climbing net sprite flag and timer. Whenever you punch the flipping net, this gets set to #$1E and decrements every frame till it's zero. That's how many frames the spinning animation lasts. It also determines the X speed the player has while he's on the climbing net sprite - this means that it should be decremented every frame in order to avoid issues.
$7E:149E	1 byte	Timer	Player punches while climbing on a net flag and timer. Every time you punch a net this is set to #$08 and decremented till it's zero again. During the time it's not zero, the frame is displayed that shows the player punching the net. If you store #$08 or greater to it every frame you'll be hold onto the net without being able to move or get off.
When this RAM address is non-zero, the player can also not move.
$7E:149F	1 byte	Timer	This timer controls the time until the player gets into gliding/sinking mode after he has jumped into the air with a cape. Is set to #$50 the moment you get airborne, and decrements every frame afterwards. The ability of raising any further stops at #$00.
$7E:14A0	1 byte	Timer	How long the running frames should be shown after the player launches off with the cape. Is #$10 by default and decrements each frame.
$7E:14A1	1 byte	Timer	Player slides a bit when turning around timer. Most notably used with very steep slopes. If this is non-zero, $7E:13DD's image (#$0D) won't be shown.
$7E:14A2	1 byte	Timer	Used as a timer for the cape animation. This is what makes the cape wave when the player walks and what makes the cape fall when he stops.
$7E:14A3	1 byte	Timer	A timer for Yoshi's tongue stretching out.
#$12 = Yoshi about to stretch out tongue (timer starts here), player pose #$27.
#$10 = $7E:18AE is set to #$06.
#$0C = Player now gets a different pose, #$28.
#$00 = Player now gets a different pose, #$20 (or #$21 if turning around, $7E:187A is used to determine that).
$7E:14A4	1 byte	Timer	Time until the player advances a diving stage, while flying and holding forward, and time until the player pulls back up a stage, while flying and holding backward.
$7E:14A5	1 byte	Timer	Timer for how long you keep floating after releasing B when floating with the cape.
$7E:14A6	1 byte	Player	Cape spin timer.
$7E:14A7	1 byte	Timer	Timer for breaking the bridge in Reznor battles. It is set to #$40 and decrements each frame. When it reaches #$3C, a tile on each side breaks. When it drops to #$00, a sound is played and it's reset to #$40 again.
$7E:14A8	3 bytes	Misc.	Unused, and decrement every frame automatically until they reach zero. $7E:14A9 is cleared when the player ground pounds with the cape (this can be prevented by setting $02:94C6/0x116C6 to NOP #3 or [EA EA EA]), and $7E:14AA is set to #$40 when Yoshi grabs the wings (this can be stopped by setting $01:F6CF/0xF8CF to NOP #3 or [EA EA EA]).
$7E:14AB	1 byte	Timer	Bonus game ending timer. Does nothing in a normal level, but during a bonus game, setting it will end the bonus game and return to the overworld. At #$44 it starts the "end bonus game" music, and at #$01 it actually fades to the overworld.
$7E:14AC	1 byte	Empty	Empty. However, due to the code at $00:C563/0x04763 and $00:C513/0x04713, it decrements every fourth frame until it hits zero.
$7E:14AD	1 byte	Timer	Blue P-Switch timer.
$7E:14AE	1 byte	Timer	Silver P-Switch timer.
$7E:14AF	1 byte	Flag	On/Off Switch value. #$00 is ON and all others (non-zero, i.e. #$01-#$FF) are OFF.
$7E:14B0	2 bytes	Misc.	Used for multiple purposes.

The 16-bit address forms the center X position of the brown chained platform that is currently processed. The formula for this address = $7E:14B4 - $7E:14BC.

Additionally, the Lakitu cloud graphics routine uses $7E:14B0 as scratch RAM for the X position of a tile.

$7E:14B0 is furthermore used in the Bowser battle as a timer between his various attacks. Set to #$78 at the beginning, and between attacks afterwards it is set to #$54 each time.
Note that, whether he throws the Mechakoopas or not, does not only depend on this address!

And finally, $7E:14B1 is a timer that is set to #$FF when Bowser begins with the Mechakoopa attack. Note that the Mechakoopas are thrown when this timer is at #$80.
$7E:14B2	2 bytes	Misc.	Used for multiple purposes.

The 16-bit address forms the center Y position of the brown chained platform that is currently processed. Note that, since the radius based on the sprite Y position is always zero, this holds the same value as $7E:14B6. The formula for this address = $7E:14B6 - $7E:14BF.

Additionally, the Lakitu cloud graphics routine uses $7E:14B2 as scratch RAM for the Y position of a tile.

$7E:14B2 is also a flag for scaling when Bowser is flying away. #$00 = shrinking; #$01 = growing; #$02 = disappear.

And finally, $7E:14B3 is an incrementing index to the Y position for the teardrop tile that appears on the Clown Car when Bowser is hurt.
$7E:14B4	2 bytes	Misc.	Used for multiple purposes.

The 16-bit address is the X position of the brown chained platform sprite at cos a = 1. It is in fact a mirror of the sprite X position, which always stays the same. By subtracting the horizontal radius ($7E:14BC) from this address, the center position to revolve around is calculated.

The 16-bit address is also used to determine Iggy/Larry interactive X position, as well as the player's fireball X position during this boss battle.

$7E:14B4 is used in the Bowser battle as an index to what music should be played in phase 2 and 3. It only appears to have these values after written to:
#$07 = Use track #$19.
#$08 = Use track #$1A.
Both tracks are identical. Perhaps this seperation was intended to be used so that a different track played on each phase.

And finally, $7E:14B5 is a timer for Bowser's hurt state. If non-zero, Bowser will show his hurt pose.
$7E:14B6	2 bytes	Sprites	Used for multiple purposes.

The 16-bit address is the Y position of the brown chained platform sprite at sin a = 0. It is in fact a mirror of the sprite Y position, which always stays the same. By subtracting the horizontal radius ($7E:14BF) from this address, the center position to revolve around is calculated. Since $7E:14BF is always zero, the center position and this address always have the same identical value.

The 16-bit address is also used to determine Iggy/Larry interactive Y position, as well as the player's fireball Y position during this boss battle.

$7E:14B6 is also a timer that is set to #$FF when Bowser begins with the Big Steelie attack. Note that the Big Steelie is thrown when this timer is at #$80.

And finally, $7E:14B7 holds the X position of each new fireball that falls from the sky in the Bowser battle, as well as the index to the sound effects that are generated with them (table at $03:A841).
$7E:14B8	2 bytes	Misc.	Used for multiple purposes.

The 16-bit address is the X position of the first (outermost) chain tile of the brown chained platform currently being processed. This address is responsible for the actual movement of the platform and interaction with the player.

$7E:14B8 itself seems to form a buffer for the X position of Iggy/Larry during that boss battle, much similar to $7E:14B4.

Lastly, $7E:14B8 is an attack counter used in the second phase of the Bowser battle to determine if Bowser should throw Mechakoopas or Big Steelies. It increments on every throw, on #$02 Mechakoopas are thrown, and on #$03 it resets to #$00.
$7E:14BA	2 bytes	Sprites	Used for multiple purposes.

The 16-bit address is the Y position of the first (outermost) chain tile of the brown chained platform currently being processed. This address is responsible for the actual movement of the platform and interaction with the player.

$7E:14BA itself seems to form a buffer for the Y position of Iggy/Larry during that boss battle, much similar to $7E:14B6.
$7E:14BC	2 bytes	Sprites	Radius of the rotating brown platform, by default this value is #$50 (found at $01:CACC). This value is subtracted from $7E:14B4 and stored into $7E:14B0.
In SMW however, the value is always #$50. Additionally, the high byte is always #$00.

Note that this radius depends on sprite X position (which stays the same). It calculates the center position of the imaginary circle you rotate around from that position.
The further you increment the radius, the further you will have to move the sprite to the right in order for the center position to be the same.

See also $7E:14BF.
$7E:14BE	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and cutscene load.
$7E:14BF	2 bytes	Sprites	Another type of radius that would rely on the brown chained platform's Y position, except that it's always #$0000, and thus effectively it does nothing. Subtracted from $7E:14B6 and stored into $7E:14B2. See also $7E:14BC.
$7E:14C1	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen, overworld and cutscene load.
$7E:14C2	2 bytes	Sprites	Used to hold the sine value of the brown rotating platform. Note that the range of this is always #$0000-#$0100. XOR isn't applied to this value when it is negative.
$7E:14C4	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen, overworld and cutscene load.
$7E:14C5	2 bytes	Sprites	Used to hold the cosine value of the brown rotating platform. Note that the range of this is always #$0000-#$0100. XOR isn't applied to this value when it is negative.
$7E:14C7	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen, overworld and cutscene load.
$7E:14C8	12 bytes	Sprites	Sprite status table. A list of possible values can be found here.

$7E:1510	12 bytes	Sprites	Miscellaneous sprite table. In SMW, it's used in the brown platform's graphics routine, but nowhere else in SMW's entire code. It is also not cleared in the sprite table clear routine, unlike every single other sprite table.
$7E:151C	12 bytes	Sprites	Miscellaneous sprite table. In SMW, it's used for vertical directions, and Yoshi uses it to determine which sprite to spawn out of an egg.
$7E:1520-$7E:1523 is a 'Reznor killed flag'. If a byte is set to #$01, the Reznor will disappear. Byte 1 is for Reznor 1, byte 2 for Reznor 2 and so on.
$7E:1528	12 bytes	Sprites	Miscellaneous sprite table. In SMW, it's used for Chargin' Chuck HP, Thwomp's face expression, etc.
$7E:1534	12 bytes	Sprites	Miscellaneous sprite table.
Certain powerups use this table as a blink-fall flag.
#$00 = Off; #$01 = On, powerup will blink and fall straight down.
The game stores #$01 here when it drops the reserved item from the item box. The blink-fall flag affects the Super Mushroom and the Fire Flower, but not the Cape Feather. The blink-fall flag also affects some other sprites, at least the Starman, the 1-Up mushroom and the coin sprite, but these sprites might glitch if you set the flag.
One glitch is that the blinking sprite-coin permanently occupies a sprite slot if it falls off the level, so that it might prevent the spawning of other common sprites.
Other than that, this address has many different purposes.
$7E:1540	12 bytes	Sprites	Miscellaneous sprite table. Table decrements itself once per frame.
Various sprites use this table as a stun timer. For example, this timer controls when flipped Goombas and squashed Mecha-Koopas decide to rise and walk. This table is also the sprite spinjump death frame counter - that is, how long to show the "spinjumped" image when the sprite is killed by a jump of such sorts.

$7E:1692	1 byte	Sprites	Sprite memory setting from header.
$7E:1693	1 byte	Blocks	For the regular tiles in SMW, this holds the low byte of the Map16 number (Y contains the high byte). Within custom block code, this contains the low byte of the "acts like" setting, Y has the high byte, and $03-$04 contain the actual Map16 number. This gets its value from a pointer to the Map16 tile table at $7E:C800 (Y gets its value from $7F:C800).
$7E:1694	1 byte	Blocks	How many pixels the sprite should move down from the nearest 16x16 tile. Originally, its data comes from the table at $00:E632.

$7E:187B	12 bytes	Sprites	Miscellaneous sprite table. Has the following purposes:

Sprite stomp immunity flag table - enables stomp immunity for sprites if the flag is set.
Additionally, the changing item sprite uses it to determine which sprite it is (#$00 = mushroom, #$40 = fire flower, #$80 = feather, #$C0 = star), the goal tape determines by this address whether it activates the normal or secret exit, the radius of rotating chain sprites is held by this address, certain Yoshi abilities are handled, etc.

$7E:1884 is also used to determine what background should be used during the Morton/Roy/Ludwig battle scene. #$00 = Ludwig; #$01 = Morton/Roy.
There is also a bug with the background flames during the Ludwig battle, as they seem to change color upon this address not being #$01. This is responsible for a palette glitch in the original SMW, where the fire turns a greyish blue very briefly. Change $02:8380 to #$80 to fix the bug.
$7E:1887	1 byte	Timer	Time to shake Layer 1.
$7E:1888	2 bytes	Misc.	Layer 1 image relative Y position, used by $7E:1887 (shaking ground). Does not affect Layer 1 interaction. #$0000 = default value, Layer 1's image unchanged. The higher the value (positive, #$0001 and beyond), the more Layer 1 goes up. The lower the value (negative, wraps around to #$FFFF and below) the more Layer 1 goes down.
$7E:188A	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load, but also on death ($00:F625/0x7825) and in the Peach Rescued scene ($03:AE39/0x1B039).
$7E:188B	1 byte	Player	Player image-relative Y position, used by $7E:1887 (shaking ground). Does not affect player interaction. Unlike $7E:1888, this is an 8-bit address.
$7E:188C	1 byte	Flag	Flag that determines if the game should keep updating the tile and YXPPCCCT data for the sprite background tiles in the Morton/Roy/Ludwig room.

#$00 = Keep updating; #$01 = Stop updating.
$7E:188D	1 byte	Misc.	Used during the calculation of the X position of the background in the Morton/Roy/Ludwig room. It starts by copying the value from $7E:001A (8-bit) and getting the lowest bit from $7E:001B by using the carry bit. So first, this address is $7E:001A (9-bit) > 1. 
This address is then, after it's inverted with EOR #$FF : INC A, used for $7E:0006 (scratch RAM, used for X displacement of all tiles).
$7E:188E	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load, cutscene load and level load.
$7E:188F	1 byte	Sprites	Used to indicate whether the bonus game is over. It will disable the interaction and movement.
$7E:1890	1 byte	Counter	How many 1-Ups to spawn. (Used for bonus game.)
$7E:1891	1 byte	Timer	P-balloon timer. Ticks down one step per four frames.
Note that setting this doesn't make the player fly away. The flight controller is $7E:13F3.
$7E:1892	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite number. The pointer for those is at $02:F825/0x17A25. A list of possible values, as well as more information on cluster sprites in general, can be found here.
$7E:18A6	1 byte	Empty	Unused RAM. Referenced at $01CF9E (Morton's code) but never actually used. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:18A7	1 byte	Blocks	This address is a mirror of $7E:1693, which holds the Map16 number of the current block that is being checked. Primarily used in the Chargin' Chuck turn/throw block detection code.
$7E:18A8	2 bytes	Sprites	Morton and Roy left and right pillar status. $7E:18A8 controls the left pillar, whereas $7E:18A9 is used for the right pillar.
#$00 = Pillar is not falling yet.
#$01 = Pillar is falling.
#$81 = Pillar has fallen.
$7E:18AA	2 bytes	Sprites	Morton and Roy left and right pillar Y positions. $7E:18AA is the left pillar, $7E:18AB is the right pillar.
The pillar status ($7E:18A8 and $7E:18A9) is set to #$81 (pillar has fallen) as soon as this Y position becomes #$B0.
The Y speed here accelerates slightly - see $02:83F8 for reference.
$7E:18AC	1 byte	Yoshi	Timer on when Yoshi will swallow the sprite in his mouth. It ticks down one step every fourth frame, and Yoshi's swallowing animation starts when this is #$26 or lower.
$7E:18AD	1 byte	Yoshi	Frame counter for Yoshi's walking frames. It goes from #$00-#$02, forms an index for the image table at $01:EDEE, and becomes #$02 when it gets lower than #$00 (frame counter decrements).
This address is comparable with the player's version, at $7E:13DB.
$7E:18AE	1 byte	Timer	How long it takes for Yoshi's tongue to come out after the player "hits" Yoshi (after $7E:14A3 becomes #$10). Starts at #$06 and decrements each frame.
$7E:18AF	1 byte	Yoshi	Yoshi squatting timer. It's set to #$0C once the player hops onto Yoshi, decrements once every frame, and takes care of the ducking frame.
$7E:18B0	2 bytes	Yoshi	Yoshi's X position. Used only to determine where Yoshi is when eating a berry (by means of walking into one, not sticking his tongue out).
$7E:18B2	2 bytes	Yoshi	Yoshi's Y position. Used only to determine where Yoshi is when eating a berry (by means of walking into one, not sticking his tongue out).
$7E:18B4	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:18B5	1 byte	Flag	Cleared when standing on the ground, set when standing on the floor of the unused winged cage. It tells whether the player should be following the cage or layer 1.
$7E:18B6	1 byte	Misc.	Sometimes used to keep track of a tile to generate at $00:BEB0 (before storing to $7E:009C); may be in conjunction with $7E:185E. Also used to determine the player X position when he's on the line guided rope, used when the player is on top of Boo Block, etc.
$7E:18B7	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:18B8	1 byte	Flag	Run cluster sprite code.
#$00 = No; #$01 = Yes.
$7E:18B9	1 byte	Sprites	Generator type that is currently active. #$01 = Eerie Generator; #$02 = Para Goomba; and so on. The pointer for this address is located at $02:B00C/0x1320C.
$7E:18BA	1 byte	Sprites	Index to the Boo rings that are on screen (maximum is two). Additionally, depending on bit 0 of this byte, the reappearing ghosts use position combination 1 or 2.
$7E:18BB	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:18BC	1 byte	Sprites	Floating skull speed. It's set to #$00 in the sprite initial routine, and set to #$0C when the player touches the sprite.
$7E:18BD	1 byte	Timer	Time to stun the player. It will make the player face the screen and make him unable to move.
$7E:18BE	1 byte	Flag	Flag used to tell if the player can climb on air. The line guided ropes use this to let the player get onto them.
$7E:18BF	1 byte	Timer	Timer used by a bunch of appearing/disappearing sprites (examples: Lakitu, Magikoopa, and Layer 3 smasher). Sprite D2 freezes it by incrementing the timer - effectively getting rid of the decrements applied by said sprites.
$7E:18C0	1 byte	Timer	Timer for respawning certain sprites, such as the Boo Buddies or sprite E5 (and Lakitu). Sprite D2, Turn Off Generator 2, sets this to zero when it is active.
$7E:18C1	1 byte	Sprites	Used by Magikoopa and Lakitu to determine which sprite number should respawn when $7E:18BF is zero.
$7E:18C2	1 byte	Flag	Player is inside Lakitu cloud flag.
#$00 = Not inside Lakitu cloud.
#$01 = Inside Lakitu cloud.
If the latter, the player does not animate as if he were walking or floating.
$7E:18C3	2 bytes	Sprites	Y position of the respawning sprite, used with $7E:18C0 (respawn timer) and $7E:18C1 (respawn sprite number).
$7E:18C5	8 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:18CD	1 byte	Sprites	Bounce sprite (alternative) index.
$7E:18CE	4 bytes	Timer	Spinning turn block timer - amount of frames a spinning turn block lasts. When it hits zero, it reverts to a regular turn block.
$7E:18D2	1 byte	Player	This address is incremented every time the player kills a sprite with a star while the star is active and will reset when the star runs out.
#$01 = 200; #$02 = 400; #$03 = 800; #$04 = 1000; #$05 = 2000; #$06 = 4000; #$07 = 8000; #$08 and above = 1-Up
$7E:18D3	1 byte	Timer	Write a value to here, and sparkles (like the ones from the stars) will fly around the player for that amount of frames. However, it is never used in the original game.
Note that if the player has an invincibility star, this timer will wait until the star runs out.
$7E:18D4	1 byte	Yoshi	Red berries eaten by Yoshi. After 10 berries, the counter resets and Yoshi lays an egg, containing a mushroom.
$7E:18D5	1 byte	Yoshi	Pink berries eaten by Yoshi. After 2 berries, the counter resets and Yoshi lays an egg, containing a coin game cloud.
$7E:18D6	1 byte	Yoshi	Type of the current berry being eaten. #$00 = Coin (no effect except getting a coin), #$01 = Red, #$02 = Pink, #$03 = Green. Controls both color and what happens when Yoshi eats the berry.
$7E:18D7	1 byte	Sprites	This is the high byte of the Map16 tile (actual tile number, not "acts like" setting) that a sprite is touching vertically.

This is set after $01:9138, the subroutine that allows the sprite to interact with objects, is called. (This includes $01:802A, the routine that updates sprite position with gravity, which calls $01:9138.)
$7E:18D8	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load, cutscene load and level load.
$7E:18D9	1 byte	Timer	Timer for the castle/ghost house door in the intro sequence. The castle door starts at #$FF, the ghost house door starts at #$7F.
For the castle door: start rising and generate first sound at #$B0, rise until #$81, stay still until #$30, then sink and generate second sound at #$01.
For the ghost house door: open and generate first sound at #$76, then close and generate second sound at #$08.
$7E:18DA	1 byte	Yoshi	Sprite number that spawns when Yoshi lays an egg. Valid values are #$74 (mushroom) and #$6A (coin game cloud).
$7E:18DB	1 byte	Empty	Set to #$08 at $00:CDD4 (unreachable by default) and never touched again. Might have been intended as a starting index for the player's fireballs.
Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:18DC	1 byte	Yoshi	Flag that is set when the player is ducking with Yoshi. They cannot turn around in this state. If you were to use the debug codes at $00:D085-$00:D089 (x5285 - x5289), this also makes the fireballs that the player fires when on Yoshi appear at a different position.
$7E:18DD	1 byte	Counter	Number of silver coins collected.
$7E:18DE	1 byte	Yoshi	Timer that determines how long it takes before an egg is laid by Yoshi, when 10 red Berries have been eaten. Is set to #$20 by default. Also, as long as this timer is above #$01, the player is frozen ($7E:13FB is set).
$7E:18DF	1 byte	Sprites	ID (index to $7E:009E and similar) of the current Yoshi, plus 1. Set to #$00 when the Yoshi despawns.
$7E:18E0	1 byte	Timer	Timer for how long stolen Lakitu clouds should remain before evaporating. Decrements once every four frames.
$7E:18E1	1 byte	Sprites	ID of the Lakitu cloud (index to the sprite table that corresponds to the Lakitu cloud sprite). Contains a valid value even if the Lakitu itself is still alive.
$7E:18E2	1 byte	Yoshi	Loose Yoshi Flag. If set, any Yoshis spawned will become 1-Ups instead. It's also Yoshi's index in the sprite table, plus 1.
$7E:18E3	1 byte	Sprites	How many of the coins from the coin game cloud (the one that appears if Yoshi eats two pink berries) the player has collected. Oddly enough, it's cleared if you get hurt.
$7E:18E4	1 byte	Misc.	1-Up handler. Write to it to give that many lives. Handles everything except the 1-Up/2-Up/etc. graphics.
$7E:18E5	1 byte	Timer	Amount of time until the next life is given through the 1-Up handler ($7E:18E4).
$7E:18E6	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:18E7	1 byte	Yoshi	Yoshi ground stomp flag. #$00 = Yoshi does not stomp the ground when landing on it; #$01 = Yoshi does stomp the ground when landing on it.
This is set to #$01 when a Yellow Yoshi has a shell in its mouth, or when any Yoshi has a yellow shell in its mouth.
$7E:18E8	1 byte	Yoshi	Yoshi growing animation timer. Starts at #$40 and then decrements. Additionally, it freezes everything on the screen except Yoshi.
$7E:18E9	1 byte	Sprites	Occasionally used to index $7E:17C0 (smoke image table). If there are no empty slots left when a smoke image should be spawned, the oldest one is removed and the index is reset.
$7E:18EA	12 bytes	Sprites	Minor extended sprite X position, high byte.
$7E:18F6	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load, cutscene load and level load.
$7E:18F7	1 byte	Sprites	Score sprite index.
$7E:18F8	4 bytes	Sprites	Time for a bounce sprite to interact with a normal sprite. Starts at #$06 and decrements. Actual interaction doesn't occur until the value is lower than #$03, though, and $7E:16CD has to be non-zero.
$7E:18FC	1 byte	Sprites	Alternative extended sprite index, used when the extended sprite tables are full. Holds the first available extended sprite index and resets to #$07 if all of them have been filled and another extended sprite is spawned.
$7E:18FD	1 byte	Sprites	Flag set when Whistlin' Chuck whistles, even when it's the Super Koopa-generating kind. Setting this makes Rip van Fish chase the player.
$7E:18FE	1 byte	Sprites	The diagonal and surrounded bullet bills timer. It increments every second frame, and when it reaches #$A0, it sends out some more Bullet Bills and resets itself.
$7E:18FF	1 byte	Sprites	Shooter index for the current shooter that is being processed.
$7E:1900	1 byte	Counter	Bonus stars gained at level end - decrements to zero.
$7E:1901	4 bytes	Sprites	YXPPCCCT data of bounce sprite that is being shown.
$7E:1905	1 byte	Counter	Iggy's/Larry's platform total number of tilts made counter. It will increment everytime the platform will be at a maximum tilt.
Only the lowest bit is ever used, and it controls which direction it should move.
$7E:1906	1 byte	Timer	Iggy/Larry's platform stationary phase timer. Is set to #$40 and decrements every frame. As long as it's not zero, the platform won't rotate.
$7E:1907	1 byte	Counter	Iggy's platform rotation phase counter.
#$00 = First phase, tilting left.
#$01 = First phase, tilting right.
#$02 = Second phase, tilting left.
#$03 = Second phase, tilting right.
#$04 = Third phase, tilting left steeply.
#$05 = Third phase, tilting right steeply.
After the third phase ends, the counter resets.
$7E:1908	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and level load.
$7E:1909	1 byte	Flag	Flag that makes the creating/eating block run or not run. #$FF = don't run, any other value = run. Set to #$00 when a brown block is touched.
$7E:190A	1 byte	Sprites	Reappearing Boo frame counter. They start appearing at #$FF, become fully opaque at #$DF, start disappearing at #$3F, and become fully invisible at #$1F. The counter decrements every frame and doesn't stop when it hits #$00 unless sprite D2 is active, which causes it to freeze at #$FF.
$7E:190B	1 byte	Sprites	Big Boo Boss palette index, used for the transparency effect. The reappearing Boos (cluster sprites) also use this. They set this address to #$08.
$7E:190C	1 byte	Timer	Directional coin timer.
$7E:190D	1 byte	Flag	Used as a flag in the Bowser battle for whether or not the final cutscene is playing. Used to remove the item box, as well as several palette updates and using a different OAM index for the roof tiles. Any non-zero value activates the flag.
$7E:190E	1 byte	Sprites	Sprite buoyancy settings from level header. Format: XY-- ---- (bits)
X = Enable sprite buoyancy. This reduces the number of sprites that can be on the screen at once without slowing down.
Y = Enable sprite buoyancy and disable all other sprite interaction with layer 2. This reduces the processing cost and slowdown.
$7E:190F	12 bytes	Sprites	Sprite properties, sixth Tweaker/MWR byte.
Format: wcdj5sDp
w=Don't get stuck in walls (carryable sprites)
c=Don't turn into a coin with silver POW
d=Death frame 2 tiles high
j=Can be jumped on with upward Y speed
5=Takes 5 fireballs to kill. Clear means it's killed by one. The hit counter is at $7E:1528.
s=Can't be killed by sliding
D=Don't erase when goal passed
p=Make platform passable from below
$7E:191B	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load, and every frame when Yoshi is on screen. The latter can be disabled by changing [9C 1B 19] at $01:EBD9/0xEDD9 to [80 01 EA].
$7E:191C	1 byte	Yoshi	Indicates whether or not Yoshi has a key in his mouth. #$00 = no, #$01 = yes.
$7E:191D	1 byte	Sprites	Index for the cluster sprites that make up Sumo Brother flames, as they are being generated.
$7E:191E	1 byte	Misc.	Is set to a value #$00-#$03 when pressing a big switch. Depending on the value, either a green, yellow, blue or red flat switch sprite will be left behind in the room.
$7E:191F	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1920	1 byte	Counter	How many 1-Ups from the bonus game are still not collected. Decrements every time a 1-Up is collected. The bonus game ends when this address hits zero.
$7E:1921	1 byte	Misc.	During the cutscene after defeating Bowser, indicates which letter the "Mario's adventure is over..." message is currently at. Ends at #$54.
$7E:1922	1 byte	Should be 00	High byte of $7E:1921. This is never any value other than #$00 in the original SMW, but since $7E:1921 is sometimes loaded in 16-bit mode, it's not a good idea to use it if you're using the original Bowser battle. Cleared on reset, title screen load, and overworld load.
$7E:1923	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1925	1 byte	Misc.	Level mode settings from level header.
$7E:1926	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1928	1 byte	Misc.	One of two screen numbers used in the level loading routine. This one points to where the current object is placed and is never changed inside an object loading code. The other screen number is $7E:1BA1.

It is also used in the credits as a pointer to which background should be used for which part of the credits roll.
$7E:1929	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:192A	1 byte	Misc.	Level header RAM address. Format: swaaaaaa. s = slippery level, w = water level, a = player action. If one of bits 3-5 is set, the player action will be "vertical pipe exit downwards, water level".
$7E:192B	1 byte	Graphics	Sprite GFX set that is currently used.
$7E:192C	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:192D	1 byte	Misc.	FG palette settings from the level header.
$7E:192E	1 byte	Misc.	Sprite palette settings from the level header.
$7E:192F	1 byte	Misc.	Background color settings from the level header.
$7E:1930	1 byte	Misc.	Background palette settings from the level header.
$7E:1931	1 byte	Misc.	Tileset setting from level header. Also used on the overworld and in cutscenes to determine what graphics should be uploaded.
$7E:1932	1 byte	Misc.	Copy of the tileset setting from the level header. Never read by anything.
$7E:1933	1 byte	Misc.	Layer being processed. #$00 = Layer 1; #$01 = Layer 2/3 (depending on which is interactive). Used in both level loading routine and processing interactions.
$7E:1934	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1935	1 byte	Flag	When set to a non-zero value, it'll overwrite tiles #$4A-#$4F and #$5A-#$5F with graphics which it gets from $7E:0BF6 on level load. Used by the MARIO START! sign. Flag is immediately cleared after that.
$7E:1936	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1938	128 bytes	Sprites	Sprite load status within the level.
Loaded sprites' indices to this table are stored in the sprite table at $7E:161A. Shooters' indices are stored to $7E:17B3.
All sprites are set to #$00 when the player enters a new area, meaning they are marked to be loaded.
If a sprite's value is set to anything else, it will not reload until the player exits and re-enters the area.
$7E:19B8	32 bytes	Misc.	Exit Table. This connects doors and exit-enabled pipes to their correct entrances.
The index for this exit table is the position of the exit (relative to layer 1) divided by 256. If layer 1 is vertical, then use the Y position of the exit, else use the X position. This is also known as the current screen number.
For primary exits, the value in this exit table is the low 8 bits of the level number of the destination room. For secondary exits, the value in this exit table is the index to the secondary entrance ROM tables; and ROM table $05:F800/0x2FA00 provides the low 8 bits of the room number.
$7E:19D8	32 bytes	Misc.	Exit Table, flags + high bit.
Bit 0 = High bit of level number (1 = level 1xx; 0 = level 0xx)
Bit 1 = Secondary Exit Flag
Bit 2 = Exit Present Flag (set if any exit is on this screen)
Bit 3 = Make Destination Water Flag (Secondary Exit only)
Bits 4-7 = Unused

Only used when Lunar Magic is done with the ROM.
$7E:19F8	384 bytes	Misc.	Three tables of 128 bytes each for remembering which items have been collected (item memory settings). If the corresponding bits are set (items are collected), those objects will not be reloaded.
The tables are split up like this: every screen number has 4 bytes designated to it. The first byte is for the top-left quarter of the screen, the second byte for the top-right quarter, the third byte for the bottom-left quarter and the fourth byte for the bottom-right quarter. Each vertical column within these quarters uses one bit.

Item memory setting 3 doesn't actually exist in the original game, but LM still allows you to select it. As of LM 1.8, it is apparently possible to use item memory setting 3 as well, but it only means "make everything respawn" and doesn't remember anything.
$7E:1B78	2 bytes	Overworld	This is used on the overworld to determine if a hard coded path should be processed. This flag is set and read in 16-bit mode, it can have the values #$0000 or #$0001. #$0001 means that a hard coded path/event is processed.
$7E:1B7A	2 bytes	Overworld	This address serves as index to $04:9086 which is used to get what hard coded tile to use for the current tile the player is walking on. This address plus one is also the index to $04:90CA.
$7E:1B7C	1 byte	Overworld	Accumulating fraction bits for the Layer 1 X speed on the overworld, used when the camera returns to the player after having been in free scrolling mode. This address handles incrementing the Layer 1 X position when it overflows.
$7E:1B7D	1 byte	Overworld	Accumulating fraction bits for the Layer 1 Y speed on the overworld, used when the camera returns to the player after having been in free scrolling mode. This address handles incrementing the Layer 1 Y position when it overflows.
$7E:1B7E	1 byte	Overworld	This address is a mirror of $7E:13C1 (tile the player is on in the overworld) and it's used to check whether the player is walking on a complementive corner tile (those small corners used with the paths, a list of all tile numbers can be found at $04:A03C) while settling on a level tile.
Appears to be designed to allow for (very) curvy paths leading to level tiles, found in for example Star World and the path to the warp pipe from Chocolate Island 2.
Depending on the complementive corner tile in question, the player image and position are altered when settling on a level tile.
$7E:1B7F	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and titlescreen load.

This address could be regarded as the "high byte" of $7E:1B7E, however it is never used (AND #$00FF is applied) and only stored to on the overworld. Thus, it is safe to use this address as free RAM outside of the overworld.
$7E:1B80	1 byte	Overworld	Player is on a climbing tile flag.
#$00 = Player is not on a climbing tile.
#$01 = Player is on a climbing tile.
$7E:1B81	1 byte	Should be 00	Uses in 16-bit loads to $7E:1B80, and otherwise #$00 is always stored here. Using this outside of the overworld is fine, however. Cleared on reset, titlescreen load and overworld load.
$7E:1B82	1 byte	Overworld	X position on-screen of the current castle/fortress destruction explosion. Also denotes X position on-screen of the appearing event sprite tiles.
$7E:1B83	1 byte	Overworld	Y position on-screen of the current castle/fortress destruction explosion. Also denotes Y position on-screen of the appearing event sprite tiles.
$7E:1B84	2 bytes	Timer	The 16-bit address is used to determine whether the large event tiles (6x6) are uploaded or the small event tiles (2x2). It's #$0900 or higher if it's the latter. It gets its values from the table at $04:DD8D.

Solely $7E:1B84 is a timer used for handling castle/fortress destruction on the overworld, as well as the timer used for a level tile being revealed (the flash sprite).
$7E:1B86	1 byte	Pointer	Pointer to the various routines that handle overworld events being activated. The pointers are located at $04E577.

#$00 = Check if an event needs to run, and check if a "explosion" is needed.
#$01 = Show the castle/P-switch "explosion".
#$02 = Set up the event index counters.
#$03 = Get layer 2 event tile.
#$04 = Animate the fade in for layer 2 tile.
#$05 = Get layer 1 event tile.
#$06 = Animate the fade in for layer 1 tile.
#$07 = End of event, marks event as run.
$7E:1B87	1 byte	Pointer	Overworld continue/save prompt trigger.

#$01 = Init of game over, continue screen. If 2-Player flag is on ($7E:0DB2 is non-zero), go to following value.
#$02 = Preparing $7E:1B8A, go to following value, fading into the 'swap lives between players' screen.
#$03 = Swap lives between players screen.
#$04 = Fading out of the 'swap lives between players' screen.
#$05 = Init of save prompt.
#$06 = Fading into save prompt.
#$07 = Save prompt screen.
#$08 = Fading out of save prompt.
$7E:1B88	1 byte	Flag	Message box expanding (#$00) or shrinking (#$01) flag. Also used in various other instances such as the save prompt on the overworld.
$7E:1B89	1 byte	Misc.	Message box expansion and shrinking timer/size. Note: Setting expanding timer above #$04 will cause the message to be blank. Also used in various other instances such as the save prompt on the overworld.
$7E:1B8A	1 byte	Flag	Which direction to point the arrow on the give lives menu.
#$00 = Point to Luigi's direction, give him lives.
#$01 = Point to Mario's direction, give him lives.
$7E:1B8B	1 byte	Overworld	A timer that increments every frame, used for the blinking arrow on the give lives (between players) screen. If $7E:1B8B & #$18 gives a non-zero value, the arrow is shown. If the result of that is zero instead, a blank is shown.
$7E:1B8C	1 byte	Flag	Used as a flag to determine whether you are at the first or second iteration of the pointer to $04:DB18 ($7E:1DE8 is #$00 or #$06). #$02 is fully cleared, #$00 is fully blacked out. Needed to make the windowing HDMA fade out at first, then fade back in when the submap switching process is done.
$7E:1B8D	2 bytes	Overworld	Used in the calculation of the X positions for the overworld fade in/out windowing HDMA transitions. Removing stores to this address will make it only active in the Y direction. Starts at #$0000 (completely black) and ends at #$7000 (cleared, except for the sides which are hidden under the overworld border).
$7E:1B8F	2 bytes	Overworld	Used in the calculation of the Y positions for the overworld fade in/out windowing HDMA transitions. Removing stores to this address will make it only active in the X direction. Starts at #$0000 (completely black) and ends at #$5400 (cleared).
$7E:1B91	1 byte	Counter	Blinking cursor frame counter (file select, save prompt, etc.)
$7E:1B92	1 byte	Misc.	Position of the cursor on the title screen menus.
$7E:1B93	1 byte	Misc.	Use Secondary Exits flag. This is likely not used when Lunar Magic is done with the ROM.
$7E:1B94	1 byte	Flag	Disable bonus game sprite from being loaded flag. If not zero, the bonus game sprite will terminate itself in the init routine.
$7E:1B95	1 byte	Flag	This flag is set to #$02 as soon as the Yoshi wings animation (#$08 of $7E:0071) brings you above the screen ($7E:0080 = #$FFC0), which means you will be heading for level C8 or 1C8.
A bycoming effect is that Yoshi will have wings in that level, and that you can't die from falling into the depths. Moreover, as you enter the level, Yoshi will always be blue. It's also the only way you can "die" with Yoshi without losing him on the overworld.
$7E:1B96	1 byte	Flag	Side exit enabled flag. #$00 = Disabled; #$01 = enabled.
$7E:1B97	2 bytes	Empty	This address is only stored to once in all of SMW, and that's in code that was originally never used (the fifth scrolling command, sprite #$EC). It was going to have some unknown use when you reached the last screen of the level. Because SMW never executes the code that writes to it (unless that command is used), this is a safe address to use.

Cleared on reset, titlescreen load, overworld load and cutscene load.
$7E:1B99	1 byte	Flag	Used in goal point marching: flag to show peace image flag and handling the fade-out ellipse.
#$00 = Don't show peace image yet, don't handle fade-out ellipse.
#$01 = Show peace image and handle fade-out ellipse.
$7E:1B9A	1 byte	Graphics	Background scroll Activated Flag. The unused orange platform (sprite 5E) sets it to #$01, and the flying turn blocks (sprite C1) set it to #$08. Both values act identically, and neither does anything unless the relevant generator (sprite F4) is nearby.
$7E:1B9B	1 byte	Flag	Used to check if Yoshi should not reappear for the next room (castle intro cutscene and the likes). These cutscenes set the flag to #$01, which makes Yoshi not reappear for the next room, but it does keep Yoshi on the overworld. Automatically set to #$00 when the overworld is loaded again. One could use this RAM address to disable Yoshi for one room, but re-enable him in the next again.
$7E:1B9C	1 byte	Overworld	Player is entering a warp pipe/star flag.
#$00 = No; #$01 = Yes.
$7E:1B9D	1 byte	Timer	Time to wait until the rising/sinking tide starts rising/sinking again (after the "no movement" interval).
$7E:1B9E	1 byte	Flag	Music has to be altered on the overworld during a 2-player game flag.
#$00 = Do not alter music.
#$01 = Do alter music.
It's set when the players are switching, but also when you go from submap to submap, the latter even when it's a 1-player game. But this flag is never read if it's a 1-player game.
$7E:1B9F	1 byte	Counter	Number of broken tile pairs in the Reznor battle.
$7E:1BA0	1 byte	Overworld	The overworld uses this address to shake the ground as the Valley of Bowser entrance rises from the depths, by setting this address to #$FF. It also changes the music and adds some sound effects. It's a timer, but it only decrements as long as $7E:13D9 is #$02.
$7E:1BA1	1 byte	Misc.	One of two screen numbers used in the level loading routine. This one points to where the next tile will be placed and is often changed inside an object loading code. The other screen number is $7E:1928.
Although referenced at $03:DF58 (Bowser's code), its value isn't actually used there.
$7E:1BA2	1 byte	Sprites	Bits 0-6 form the index to the tilemap for the Mode 7 bosses, which read from the table at $03:D9DE, 16 bytes per image. Bit 7 is used to control the X-flip of the tiles. What actually happens then, is that the odd graphic tile is used instead of the even graphic tile, since all Mode 7 graphics are decompressed into a regular and flipped tile. For example, tile #$01 in VRAM is the same as tile #$00 except it's flipped.
$7E:1BA3	64 bytes	Graphics	A buffer that is used for uploading Mode 7 tile data to VRAM in non-platform Mode 7 bosses. The buffer is enough to fill in an entire 8x8 tile, as each 8x8 tile requires 64 bytes in Mode 7 8bpp.

$7E:1BB2 is also used as a buffer in the graphics upload routine. The use seems to be for converting 3bpp to 4bpp format.

$7E:1BBC is used as a flag in the graphics upload routine to alter 3bpp to 4bpp conversion depending on the graphics file that is being uploaded.
$7E:1BE3	1 byte	Misc.	Layer 3 settings.
#$00 = No Layer 3; #$01 = Low and high tide; #$02 = Low tide only; #$03 = Tileset specific image.
$7E:1BE4	2 bytes	Blocks	VRAM address to start uploading data from the table at $7E:1BE6. It's used for layer 1. Big endian.
$7E:1BE6	256 bytes	Blocks	Which tiles should be used for each row of 16x16 tiles, 2 bytes per 8x8 tile, used while scrolling layer 1 (loading new tiles). In horizontal levels, $7E:1BE6-$7E:1C65 form the left column of 8x8 tiles while $7E:1C66-$7E:1CE5 form the right column of 8x8 tiles. On the overworld and in vertical levels, $7E:1BE6-$7E:1C65 form the upper row of 8x8 tiles, while $7E:1C66-$7E:1CE5 form the bottom row of 8x8 tiles.
$7E:1CE6	2 bytes	Blocks	VRAM address to start uploading data from the table at $7E:1CE8. It's used for layer 2. Big endian.
$7E:1CE8	256 bytes	Blocks	Which tiles should be used for each row of 16x16 tiles, 2 bytes per 8x8 tile, used while scrolling interactive layer 2 (loading new tiles). In horizontal levels, $7E:1CE8-$7E:1D77 form the left column of 8x8 tiles while $7E:1D78-$7E:1DE7 form the right column of 8x8 tiles. On the overworld and in vertical levels, $7E:1CE8-$7E:1D77 form the upper row of 8x8 tiles, while $7E:1D78-$7E:1DE7 form the bottom row of 8x8 tiles.
$7E:1DE8	1 byte	Overworld	This is a pointer index used for various tasks during the submap switching scene ($7E:13D9 is #$0A), possible values are:
#$00 = Commence with handling windowing HDMA.
#$01-04 = Update layer 1 on the overworld.
#$05 = Handle palette loading.
#$06 = End with windowing HDMA.
#$07 = Terminate submap switching phase by storing #$04 to $7E:13D9, make eventual submap changes (for example, what music to play).
$7E:1DE9	1 byte	Counter	Ending enemy presentation screen number at the end of the credits. Counts up to #$0C, which holds the last set of enemies (the Koopa Kids and Bowser).
$7E:1DEA	1 byte	Overworld	Overworld event to run at level end. #$FF means that no event will be run.
$7E:1DEB	2 bytes	Overworld	Event tile to load to the overworld. A starting value is set to this at level end, and it increments until it reaches the value of $7E:1DED.
$7E:1DED	2 bytes	Overworld	Last event tile to load to the overworld during a given event, set at level end.
$7E:1DEF	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:1DF0	2 bytes	Overworld	$7E:1DF0 - X position of the camera when using the overworld scroll function, low byte.
$7E:1DF1 - X position of the camera when using the overworld scroll function, high byte.
These values are only used to determine which way the camera should go to get back to the player.
$7E:1DF2	2 bytes	Overworld	$7E:1DF2 - Y position of the camera when using the overworld scroll function, low byte.
$7E:1DF3 - Y position of the camera when using the overworld scroll function, high byte.
These values are only used to determine which way the camera should go to get back to the player.
$7E:1DF4	1 byte	Misc.	Index to intro control sequence data table.
$7E:1DF5	1 byte	Timer	Frame counter to use the same controller bits for intro sequence. It's also used as timer to determine how long the Nintendo Presents screen will remain active, and a timer for how long to require the player to wait before he can dismiss the intro message.
$7E:1DF6	1 byte	Overworld	Star and Warp pipe handler. It's an index of the current star/warp pipe tile you're standing on, multiplied by two. With this index, the destination coordinates are determined.
$7E:1DF7	1 byte	Player	Used by the Star Road warp star on the overworld. Determines the speed with which the player is launched in the air during warping. The higher the value, the faster he gets launched in the air. By default the maximum is #$04, though this cap can be altered by editing $04:9E70/0x22070.
$7E:1DF8	1 byte	Timer	Used by the Star Road warp star tile on the overworld. It controls how long the player has to stay on the ground during the warp, before he actually gets launched in the air. The player gets airborne as soon as the timer hits #$31 (as it increments).
$7E:1DF9	4 bytes	I/O	SPC700 I/O Ports. Write values to play music/SFX. A list of values can be found here.
$7E:1DFD	2 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen, overworld and level load (the latter two due to new music banks being uploaded). Note that $7E:1DFD is cleared twice, due to a 16-bit store to $7E:1DFC - at $04:969F/0x2189F (LDA #$0023 : STA $1DFC) and $05:C75D/0x2C95D (LDA #$0009 : STA $1DFC).
$7E:1DFF	1 byte	I/O	A copy of $7E:1DFB, the music register. It contains the last value written to SNES register $2142. Probably used to keep the music playing between areas.
$7E:1E00	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset, titlescreen, overworld and level load (the latter two due to new music banks being uploaded).
$7E:1E01	1 byte	Empty	Empty, unused. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load. However, if the debug code at $00:CC86/0x4E86 is enabled, this address allows you to be in free roaming mode: the player can move in any direction, without being affected by objects or sprites. #$00 = none; #$01 = dash immediately; #$02 = free roaming.
$7E:1E02	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite Y position, low byte.
$7E:1E16	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite X position, low byte.
$7E:1E2A	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite Y position, high byte.
$7E:1E3E	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite X position, high byte.
$7E:1E52	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table. Used as:
- Y position of reappearing Boos, frame 1. Not relative to screen border.
- Y speed for Boos from ghost ceiling and death bats.
$7E:1E66	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table. Used as:
- X position of reappearing Boos, frame 1. Not relative to screen border.
- X speed for Boos from ghost ceiling and death bats.
$7E:1E7A	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table. Used as:
- Y position of reappearing Boos, frame 2. Not relative to screen border.
- Accumulating fraction bits for fixed point Y speed of death bats.
$7E:1E8E	20 bytes	Sprites	Cluster sprite table. Used as:
- X position of reappearing Boos, frame 2. Not relative to screen border.
$7E:1EA2	96 bytes	Overworld	Overworld level setting flags, location within the table corresponds to $7E:13BF. Format: bmesudlr.
b = level is beaten.
m = midway point has been passed.
e = no entry if level already passed.
s = open Save Prompt when level is beaten.
u = enable walking upwards.
d = enable walking downwards.
l = enable walking leftwards.
r = enable walking rightwards.

Setting $7E:1EEB to #$83 will enable the special stage features (autumn overworld palettes, etc.) in the ORIGINAL game.
$7E:1F02	15 bytes	Overworld	Overworld event flags. The table works bitwise - if a bit corresponding to an event is set, that event has been run. If it's clear, it hasn't been run yet.

There's a little formula for finding out what event number corresponds to which bit. Take the event number, divide by eight and use that as index for this table. Take the remainder, and that number (0-7) is the position of the bit inside the indexed byte (left to right).
Example: Finding event #$13. Division by eight turns #$02 as index (so $7E:1F04) and #$03 as the remainder. It's bit 4 of $7E:1F04 (xxxx xxxx). Not bit 3, because of the "reversed" AND tables that are used with this table - bits are not counted from right to left, but from left to right instead.
$7E:1F11	1 byte	Overworld	Current submap for Mario. #$00 = Main map; #$01 = Yoshi's Island; #$02 = Vanilla Dome; #$03 = Forest of Illusion; #$04 = Valley of Bowser; #$05 = Special World; #$06 = Star World.
$7E:1F12	1 byte	Overworld	Current submap for Luigi. #$00 = Main map; #$01 = Yoshi's Island; #$02 = Vanilla Dome; #$03 = Forest of Illusion; #$04 = Valley of Bowser; #$05 = Special World; #$06 = Star World.
$7E:1F13	4 bytes	Player	Player animation on the overworld.

#$00 = Move up.
#$02 = Move down, stand still (facing the screen).
#$04 = Move left.
#$06 = Move right.
#$08 = Move up while in water.
#$0A = Move down while in water, stand still while in water (facing the screen).
#$0C = Move left while in water.
#$0E = Move right while in water.
#$10 = Sticking hand out (entering level).
#$12 = Sticking hand out while in the water (entering level).
#$14 = Climb ladder/vine, only used when descending path tile #$41.
#$16 = Climb ladder/vine, regular.

$7E:1F13/4 form Mario's image and $7E:1F15/6 form Luigi's image. Note that the high bytes of the two (bytes 2 and 4, $7E:1F14 and $7E:1F16) are actually unused.
$7E:1F17	2 bytes	Player	Overworld X position of Mario.
$7E:1F19	2 bytes	Player	Overworld Y position of Mario.
$7E:1F1B	2 bytes	Player	Overworld X position of Luigi.
$7E:1F1D	2 bytes	Player	Overworld Y position of Luigi.
$7E:1F1F	2 bytes	Player	Pointer to Mario's overworld X position. Value is Mario's regular overworld X position divided by #$10 (#16).
$7E:1F21	2 bytes	Player	Pointer to Mario's overworld Y position. Value is Mario's regular overworld Y position divided by #$10 (#16).
$7E:1F23	2 bytes	Player	Pointer to Luigi's overworld X position. Value is Luigi's regular overworld X position divided by #$10 (#16).
$7E:1F25	2 bytes	Player	Pointer to Luigi's overworld Y position. Value is Luigi's regular overworld Y position divided by #$10 (#16).
$7E:1F27	4 bytes	Flag	Switch block flags (Green, Yellow, Blue and Red). #$00 = off; only outlines, #$01-#$FF = on; solid.
$7E:1F2B	3 bytes	Empty	Empty. Cleared at reset and titlescreen load. Unlike most empty addresses, this one is saved to and loaded from SRAM.
$7E:1F2E	1 byte	Counter	Number of events triggered. Can be used as a levels beaten counter.
$7E:1F2F	12 bytes	Flag	"Collected five or more Yoshi Coins" flags, for each level.
Each seperate byte represents the values for 8 levels, with each bit acting as a flag for a given level.
If a bit is set, no Yoshi Coins will reappear in that level.

The format is as following: $7E:13BF (the level number) divided by 8 (3x LSR) provides the index per byte into this table; that's because 8 levels are represented by one byte, 1 bit per level.
For each byte, the level modulo 8 (AND #$07) is the index to the bit, and said index gets the corresponding bit from an AND table at $05:B35B.
That bit will be the flag for the level.
0 = clear bit, less than five Yoshi Coins collected; 1 = set bit, five or more Yoshi Coins collected.

An example: checking if five or more Yoshi Coins were collected in level 105. First, convert to $7E:13BF format. #$29 indicates you're in level 105.
Divide that by 8 to get the byte index - #$29 divided by 8 is five (rounded), so the sixth byte is the correct index.
After that, apply modulo 8 on #$29 - AND #$07 - and you'll end up with #$01.
This value is then used to index the aforementioned AND table, which gets the corresponding bit - in this case, #$40, bit 6.
So if bit 6 of the sixth byte ($7E:1F34) in the table is set, five or more Yoshi Coins have been collected in level 105.
$7E:1F3B	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:1F3C	12 bytes	Flag	"Collected invisible 1-Up flags", for each level.
Each seperate byte represents the values for 8 levels, with each bit acting as a flag for a given level.
If a bit is set, no invisible 1-Up will reappear in that level.

The format is as following: $7E:13BF (the level number) divided by 8 (3x LSR) provides the index per byte into this table; that's because 8 levels are represented by one byte, 1 bit per level.
For each byte, the level modulo 8 (AND #$07) is the index to the bit, and said index gets the corresponding bit from an AND table at $05:B35B.
That bit will be the flag for the level.
0 = clear bit, invisible 1-Up not collected; 1 = set bit, invisible 1-Up collected.

An example: checking if an invisible 1-Up was collected in level 105. First, convert to $7E:13BF format. #$29 indicates you're in level 105.
Divide that by 8 to get the byte index - #$29 divided by 8 is five (rounded), so the sixth byte is the correct index.
After that, apply modulo 8 on #$29 - AND #$07 - and you'll end up with #$01.
This value is then used to index the aforementioned AND table, which gets the corresponding bit - in this case, #$40, bit 6.
So if bit 6 of the sixth byte ($7E:1F41) in the table is set, an invisible 1-Up has been collected in level 105.
$7E:1F48	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:1F49	141 bytes	Overworld	Buffer for $7E:1EA2-$7E:1F2E. SRAM transfer of those bytes goes via this buffer.
$7E:1FD6	12 bytes	Sprites	Unused sprite table, cleared at individual sprite load. (1 slot each.)
$7E:1FE2	12 bytes	Sprites	Time to disable sprite contact with cape. Table decrements once per frame.
$7E:1FEE	12 bytes	Flag	"Collected 3-Up moon" flags, for each level.
Each seperate byte represents the values for 8 levels, with each bit acting as a flag for a given level.
If a bit is set, no 3-Up will reappear in that level.

The format is as following: $7E:13BF (the level number) divided by 8 (3x LSR) provides the index per byte into this table; that's because 8 levels are represented by one byte, 1 bit per level.
For each byte, the level modulo 8 (AND #$07) is the index to the bit, and said index gets the corresponding bit from an AND table.
That bit will be the flag for the level.
0 = clear bit, no 3-Up moon collected; 1 = set bit, 3-Up moon collected.

An example: checking if a 3-Up moon was collected in level 105. First, convert to $7E:13BF format. #$29 indicates you're in level 105.
Divide that by 8 to get the byte index - #$29 divided by 8 is five (rounded), so the sixth byte is the correct index.
After that, apply modulo 8 on #$29 - AND #$07 - and you'll end up with #$01.
This value is then used to index the aforementioned AND table, which gets the corresponding bit - in this case, #$40, bit 6.
So if bit 6 of the sixth byte ($7E:1FF3) in the table is set, a 3-Up moon has been collected in level 105.
$7E:1FFA	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:1FFB	1 byte	Palettes	Lightning flash color index. Only #$00-#$07 are actually used. #$07 is the brightest shade of white, the lower the value, the closer to black it gets. This address gets its value from the table at $04:F700.
$7E:1FFC	1 byte	Timer	How long to wait until the next lightning flash is generated. Gets its value from a table at $04:F6F8, which in turn gets its index from a "random" value in the routine of $04:F708 & #$07. This address decrements after the previous lightning flash has ended.
$7E:1FFD	1 byte	Timer	How long a lightning flash should last, per color change. Is set to #$08 frames for the first color flash (the most bright one), then it's set to #$04 frames for the following color flashes which are becoming less and less bright. Decrements every frame.
$7E:1FFE	1 byte	Flag	Whether to update the background in the first part of the credits, or not.
#$00 = Don't update the background.
#$01 = Do update the background.
$7E:1FFF	1 byte	Empty	Empty. Cleared on reset and titlescreen load.
$7E:2000	23,808 bytes	Graphics	GFX32 decompressed. Written while the Nintendo Presents logo is shown and never modified after that, but often read.
$7E:7D00	12,288 bytes	Graphics	GFX33 decompressed. Written while the Nintendo Presents logo is shown and never modified after that, but often read.
$7E:AD00	3,072 bytes	Graphics	GFX file decompression buffer. Decompressed as 3bpp (3kb) for unexpanded GFX and as 4bpp for expanded.
Also used for Lunar Magic's extra animated tile space.
$7E:B900 is also used as additional buffer kilobyte.
$7E:B900	1,024 bytes	Blocks	Layer 2 tilemap, low byte. Format: First two 16x27 rectangles, then 160 25s that are never read.
$7E:BD00	1,024 bytes	Blocks	Layer 2 tilemap, high byte; same format as $7E:B900. The first seven bytes are used by custom block ASM/ExAnimated Tile GFX. Writing to this area with the gfx+2 patch installed generates BG garbage and should never be done.
$7E:C100	1,408 bytes	Empty	Empty, untouched RAM on an unhacked ROM, potentially occupied with extended animated tile graphics in a hacked ROM.
$7E:C680	96 bytes	Misc.	Tilemap of Mode 7 bosses (Ludwig, Roy, Morton and Bowser).
$7E:C6E0	288 bytes	Empty	Empty, untouched RAM on an unhacked ROM, potentially occupied with extended animated tile graphics in a hacked ROM.
$7E:C800	14,336 bytes	Blocks	Map16 Low Byte Table ($7E:FE00-$7E:FFFF are unused in horizontal levels, but used in vertical ones). In the overworld, $7E:D000-$7E:D3FF is used as a table that contains translevel numbers for the big world map (the one with Donut Plains and Chocolate Island). If you divide the map into 16x16 blocks, then this table connects each block to a level. To interpret the value, see RAM $7E:13BF.
To index this table, use RAM $7E:1F1F and $7E:1F21 to find Mario, or use RAM $7E:1F23 and RAM $7E:1F25 to find Luigi.
X position / 16: %---- ---- ---X xxxx
Y position / 16: %---- ---- ---Y yyyy
index to this table: %---- --YX yyyy xxxx.
$7E:D400-$7E:D7FF is used for the submaps as a whole and has the same kind of format.
$7E:E400-$7E:EBFF is used for uploading the layer 1 tile map to VRAM in 2KB chunks. One chunk is uploaded per frame for four frames during overworld and submap transition. Data is refreshed after each DMA.
$7F:0000	16,384 bytes	Overworld	Layer 2 event tilemap of the overworld. $7F:0D00-$7F:3FFF is empty (untouched) RAM on a vanilla ROM, but LM uses it to hold the expanded layer 2 event tilemap on a hacked ROM.
LM also uses $7F:0000 and upwards to store title screen movement (three bytes every time a key is pressed or released, or if the same keys are held for #$FF frames), and $7F:0B44-$7F:1343 are also used as buffer for dynamic sprite graphics because of them being uploaded during V-Blank.
$7F:4000	16,384 bytes	Overworld	The Layer 2 tilemap of the whole overworld (including submaps, starting at $7F:6000). It does NOT affect the event tiles. The tiles are also 8x8. The tilemap starts from the top left corner of the main overworld. Format is as following:
[Tile number], [Tile properties]
This table is also used for a RAM buffer for the credit cutscene backgrounds.
$7F:8000	387 bytes	Sprites	Unrolled loop which, each frame, writes to OAM to put all sprites outside the screen.
$7F:8183	504 bytes	Empty	Empty, untouched RAM.
